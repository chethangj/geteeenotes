        <h3 style="text-align: center">NUCLEAR POWER PLANT</h3>
        <h4>Introduction:</h4>
        <p>In nuclear power plant heat is produced by the atomic energy released during the splitting of the nucleus in a nuclear reactor.</p>
        <p>This heat energy inside the reactor is utilized to produce steam either directly or indirectly. This steam is used to drive the turbine coupled to an electric generator to produce an electric power.</p>
        <h3>Working of nuclear power plant:</h3>
        <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/epg/NPP_Working.png" alt="NPP" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;">
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>In a nuclear reactor heavy radioactive elements like U<sup>235</sup> (Uranium), Th<sup>232</sup> (Thorium) are subjected to the nuclear fission reactor.</li>
            <li>In the fission reactor the nucleus of heavy atom split into number of parts (Nuclei) bombarding neutrons carried in a special reactor called nuclear reactor.</li>
            <li>During the nuclear fission reaction, huge amount of energy is released (heart energy).</li>
            <li>The heat energy is used to rise the temperature and pressure to higher value to produce steam.</li>
            <li>This high temperature and high pressure steam is passed over the steam turbine.</li>
            <li>The steam turbine converts the heat energy of steam into mechanical energy.</li>
            <li>The turbine drives an alternator coupled to it on same shaft and then alternator converts mechanical energy into an electrical energy.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Site selection of nuclear power plant:</h3>
        <h4>1. Availability of water:</h4>
        <p>Huge quantity of water should be available for water cooling and steam generation. Therefore site should be very nearer to the river or lake.</p>
        <h4>2. Distance form populated area:</h4>
        <p>The nuclear stations should be far away from the populated areas to avoid the effect of radioactivity.</p>
        <h4>3. Nearness to the load center:</h4>
        <p>The power station should be nearer to the load center to reduce the transmission cost and losses.</p>
        <h4>4. Cost and type of land:</h4>
        <p>The land price should be reasonable. The land selected for nuclear power plant should have well enough bearing capacity to withstand heavy equipments in the plant.</p>
        <h4>5. Accessibility of road and rail:</h4>
        <p>Plant has heavy equipments will have to be transported to the site during construction. Therefore site should be easily accessible by road and rail.</p>
        <h4>6. Disposal of waste:</h4>
        <p>The waste produced in s nuclear power plant by burning a fuel is radioactive in nuclear. Such products are harmful and can cause problems to the health of peoples and must be disposed quickly. So the waste is either buried in deep it’s or disposed of in sea, several km away from the shore. The site selected for such power plant should have adequate space and arrangement for the disposal of waste.</p>

        </div>
        <h4>1. Nuclear reactor:</h4>
        <p>It is an apparatus in which nuclear energy is generated with nuclear fission produced in the form of controlled chain reaction. So it is a nuclear furnace which burns fuel such as uranium U<sup>235</sup> or thorium Th<sup>232</sup> and produces products like huge amount of heat, neutrons etc.</p>
        <h4>2. Heat exchanger:</h4>
        <p>The heat exchanger utilizes the heat carried by coolant from the nuclear reactor to generate steam from water present in the water tank. Once the heat utilized completely the coolant is re-circulated to the nuclear reactor with the help of coolant circulating pump.</p>
        <h4>3. Steam turbine:</h4>
        <p>The prime mover is used in the nuclear power plant is steam turbine. The high pressure and high temperature steam is generated in the heat exchanger is passes over the steam turbine through a valve. A steam turbine converts energy of steam into mechanical energy.</p>
        <h4>4. Alternator:</h4>
        <p>An alternator is coupled with the turbine on the same shaft. So the alternator converts mechanical energy into an electrical energy.</p>
        <h4>5. Condenser or cooling system:</h4>
        <p>Cooling system or condenser is a device in which the exhaust steam from turbine is converted into water which is again delivered to the heat exchanger.</p>

            <h3>Nuclear waste disposal and safety:</h3>
            <p>The nuclear power is basically a clean energy source. As there is no noxious combustion products are generated.</p>
            <p>The wastes associated with NPP are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Solid radioactive wastes arise from filters.</li>
                <li>Sludge from the cooling ponds.</li>
                <li>Pieces of discarded fuel elements cans.</li>
                <li>Gas effluents.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Disposal:</h4>
            <p>The emission intensity of the radioactive waste is very high. They emit gamma rays which are very harmful to the living organisms because of this dangerous gamma emission of the nuclear radioactive waste. The safe disposal of nuclear waste is the major problem.</p>
            <p>There are several safety measures:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The fission solid products are stored in the shielded storage vaults, where solid waste is fixed in borosilicate glass and then this glass is stored in leak proof tight capsules. These capsules are then stored in deep salt mines. Sometimes large containers with the radioactive waste are placed at the bottom of ocean.</li>
                <li>The sludge from the cooling ponds are first heavily diluted and discharged into the ocean. Sometimes the liquid wastes are converted into clinkers of very small volume sealed in metal containers and then these containers are stored into deep salt mines.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Applications of NPP:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Electric power generation.</li>
                <li>In the area with scope for industrial development but conventional resources for power generation are limited, the nuclear power plant is the best alternative.</li>
                <li>NPP is best suited when additional power demand is to be fulfilled but conventional hydro or coal resources are limited.</li>
                <li>These plants always operate like a base load plants.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 style="text-align: center">GAS TURBINE POWER PLANT</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/epg/GTPP_Working.png" alt="GTPP" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;">
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>The working fluid used in the GTPP is air.</li>
                <li>The air is compressed in a compressor and the fuel is burned in the combustion chamber when the compressed air is supplied from the compressor.</li>
                <li>High temperature and high pressure gas is transferred to the gas turbine is coupled to the alternator.</li>
                <li>The gas turbine converts heat energy to the mechanical energy and alternator converts mechanical energy into an electrical energy.</li>
                <li>The part of the work developed by the gasses passing through the turbine is used to run the compressor and remaining 30 to 35% is used to generate the electrical energy.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Selection of site for GTPP:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The fuel should be easily available.</li>
                <li>The manpower should be easily available.</li>

            </div>
            <h4>1. Air compressor:</h4>
            <p>The compressor draws air which is at atmospheric pressure. While taking air into compressor the air is passes through an air filter to remove dust and other impurities from it. Then compressor compresses it and supplies the pressurized air to the combustion chamber through regenerator.</p>
            <h4>2. Combustion chamber:</h4>
            <p>It takes the high pressure air from the compressor through the regenerator and at the same time the fuel is also injected into the combustion chamber. Then it will be burned to produce high pressure air at high temperature and flue gasses or waste gasses or exhaust gasses are liberated to the atmosphere.</p>
            <h4>3. Regenerator:</h4>
            <p>The main function of the generator is to utilize the heat of exhaust gasses to heat compressed air before it is sent to the combustion chamber. It also reduces the fuel consumption of the plant and improves the efficiency of the plant.</p>
            <h4>4. Gas turbine:</h4>
            <p>The gas turbine is supplied with an air at high pressure and temperature. These gasses expand while passing over the blades of turbine and do the mechanical work so that the heat energy is converted to the mechanical energy.</p>
            <h4>5. Alternator:</h4>
            <p>The gas turbine is coupled to the alternator. The alternator converts mechanical energy into an electrical energy.</p>
            <p>The output from the alternator is given directly to the bus bars, transformers, circuit breaker etc.</p>
            <h4>6. Starting motor:</h4>
            <p>An electric motor used for starting compressor is mounted on the same shaft as that of the turbine. Once the unit starts (compressor) a part of mechanical power output of the turbine drives the compressor and there is no need of motor now. The motor is energized by the batteries.</p>
            <h3>Advantages of GTPP:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>GTPP’s are much simpler in design as compared to a steam power plant.</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Disadvantages of GTPP:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It requires external device for starting the plant.</li>
                <li>Major part of the work developed in the turbine is used to drive the compressor.</li>
                <li>The gas turbine blades need special cooling system.</li>
                <li>The life of the combustion and turbine blades is shorter.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Applications of GTPP:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It can be used in combined cycle plant with steam power.</li>
                <li>It can also be used in oil and gas industries because of cheaper fuel.</li>
                <li>GTPP is used in combined cycle plant with steam, diesel and hydro plants to supply peak loads.</li>
                <li>It can be used in marine fields because it can fit into the overall shape of the structure.</li>

                <li>The heat required for combustion of fuel is obtained by compression of air in the diesel engine and fuel is injected in the engine.</li>
                <li>In case of diesel engine the mechanical energy is obtained by direct combustion of fuel.</li>
                <li>An alternator or DC generator mechanically coupled to the diesel engine which converts the mechanical energy into electrical energy.</li>
                <li>In general the capacity of DPP is in the range of 2 to 50 megawatts.</li>

The sir filters helps to remove the dust from the air. The super charges increases the pressure of air supplied to the engine. So it increases the power output.</p>
            <h4>3. Engine fuel system:</h4>
            <p>The main components of fuel system are fuel tanks, fuel transfer pump, strainer, connecting pipes etc. The required fuel for whole day is pumped to the fuel tank using transfer pumps. Using strainer the suspended impurities are removed from diesel. The filtered fuel is injected to the engine with the help if fuel injection pumps.</p>
            <h4>4. Exhaust system:</h4>
            <p>The main function of the exhaust system is to discharge the engine exhaust to the atmosphere. The heat of the exhaust gasses in the exhaust system is utilized to heat the air supplied to engine.</p>
            <p>The silencer is used to reduce the noise level.</p>
            <h4>5. Cooling system:</h4>
            <p>It consists of coolant pumps, cooling towers, surge tank, connecting pipes etc. The purpose of the cooling system is to carry heat from engine cylinder to keep the temperature of the cylinder within safe limits. The pump circulates water through cylinder to carry away heat. The filter unit filters the water while entering for cooling and after cooling.</p>
            <h4>6. Engine lubrication system:</h4>
            <p>It consists of lubricating oil pump, oil tanks, filters, coolers and connecting pipes. The function of the lubrication system is to reduce the friction of the moving parts.</p>
            <h4>7. Governing system:</h4>
            <p>The main function of the governing system is to maintain the engine speed at a fixed constant value over the variation of load. The constant speed is maintained by adjusting the fuel supply into engine depending upon load.</p>
            <h4>8. Engine starting system:</h4>
            <p>It consist of self-starters, compressed air tanks etc. The function of the starting system is to start the engine from cold by compressing air. The system enables the engine to rotate initially while starting until the firing starts and the unit runs on its own power. </p>
