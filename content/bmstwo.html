            <h3 id="def">Definition</h3>
            <p>The work of keeping something in proper condition is called maintenance. The main purpose of regular maintenance is to check that all the equipment required for protection is operating at 100% efficiency at all times. So daily inspection, cleaning, lubricating and making minor adjustment, minor problems can be detected and corrected before they become the major problem that can shut down the whole production product.</p>
            <h3>Types of Maintenance:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Breakdown maintenance:</b> In this type of maintenance no care is taken for the machine until the equipment fail. Then repair is under taken later. This type of maintenance is used when the equipment failure does not affect the operation or production process and loss due to equipment failure, hence breakdown maintenance is avoided.</li><br>
                <li><b>Preventive maintenance:</b> It is also called as plan maintenance. It is important function to keep the equipment in good operation condition. It includes daily maintenance such as cleaning, inspection, oiling and retighten. To retain the healthy condition of equipment and prevent failure the minor problems can be detected and get repair avoid the equipment completely fails. If equipment fails the whole production process will be affected hence to avoid such problems preventive maintenance is necessary.</li>

            <h3 id="flow-chart">Flow Chart:</h3>
            <p>Flow chart is schematic diagram of the sequence of steps involved in a process. It provides a simple way to use and understand. By seeing the steps involved in a process, every one develops a clear picture of how the operation works and where problems could arrives?</p>
            <h3>Pareto Chart:</h3>
            <p>It is a technic used to identify quality problems based on their importance. The logic behind this char is only a few quality problems are important where as many other are not critical. This concept has been also called as 80/20 Rule. It also nothing but the most quality problems is only due to few causes. This chart is used to identify these problems.</p>

                <img src="img/bms/cause-effect.jpg" alt="pareto-chart" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            </div>
            <p>This cause identify particular quality problem. It is also called as fish bone diagram because they look like bones of fish. The head of the fish is the quality problem. The causes related to machines, workers, measurements, suppliers, materials and many others.</p>
            <p>For example, A problem with environment and the workplace could be due to improper ventilation, lighting, dust and temperature. The cause and effect diagram is problem solving tool commonly used by quality control team.</p>
            <h3 id="5s">5S Methodology:</h3>
            <p>5S means Sorting, straightening, sweeping, standard and sustaining.</p>
            <p>In Japanese language Sorting-Seiri, straightening-Seiton, Sweeping-Seiso, Standard-Seiketsu, Sustaing-Shitsuke.</p>
            <p><b>Sorting:</b> Eliminate all unnecessary tools, parts and instructions. Go through all the work area. Keep only essential items and eliminate what is not required.</p>
            <p><b>Straightening or setting in order:</b> There should be a place for everything. The place for each item should be clearly labeled. Item should be arranged in proper manor so that it should be available efficiently in the workplace. Workers should not have to bend repeatedly to access materials. Each tool, equipment should be kept close to the workplace.</p>
            <p><b>Sweeping:</b> Keep the workplace neat and clean. At the end of each shift clean the work area. This makes it easy to know what goes where and where it belongs. Maintaining cleanness should be part of daily work.</p>
            <p><b>Standard:</b> All work stations for a particular job should be identical. All employees doing the same job should be able to work in any station with the same tools that are in the same location in every station.</p>
            <p><b>Sustaining or self-discipline:</b> Once the previous 4S have been established they become an important tool to follow the steps when an issue arises make changes as appropriate.</p>
            <h3 id="pokayoke">Pokayoke:</h3>
            <p>Pokayoke is a Japanese word that means error prevention or mistake proofing. A pokayoke is a mechanism in manufacturing process that helps an operator to avoid (yoke) mistakes (poka). Its purpose is to eliminate product defects by human errors. The aim of pokayoke is to design the process so that mistakes can be detected and corrected immediately by eliminating defects at the time.</p>
            <p>Anybody should practice pokayoke in the workplace. It is usable by all workers, simple to install, low cost.</p>
            <p>Pokayoke can be used wherever something can go wrong or an error can be made. It is a technic that can be applied to any type of process in manufacturing or service industry where human errors can occur.</p>
            <p>The types of errors are,</p>
            <ol type="a">

                <li>Maintain the system.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="iso-audit">ISO Audit:</h3>
            <p>It is an assignment carried out to establish the organization to meet the requirements according to standards. Audit helps in detecting the short form (defects) in the procedure and process. It is necessary for issuing ISO certification. It is classified as internal and external audit.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Internal Audit:</b> Audit done by internal team belonging to the organization is called internal audit. It helps to spread the awareness among the organization members. The drawbacks pointed out during internal audit can be corrected before an external audit.</li>
                <li><b>External Audit:</b> Audit done by external independent agency is called external audit. It is necessary for ISO certification. External audit is capable of issuing an ISO certification for the organization. It satisfies all the requirements of ISO quality standards.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="non-conformance">Identification of Nonconformance:</h3>
            <p>It is an outcome of audit either internal or external. Those activities which do not satisfy the quality problem directly or indirectly, and which does not satisfy the customer requirements such activities are called nonconformance. The nonconformance may be a minor or a major depending on it affects the quality system of the company. Too many nonconformance decreases the quality system of the organization. Therefore steps should be taken to reduce number of nonconformance.</p>
            <p>Preventive action is necessary to avoid any failure of quality system. When nonconformance is detected, corrected action has to be taken to remove them. This maintenance of quality system within the organization improves the effectiveness of quality system.</p>
            <h3>Benefits of ISO Certification:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It provides reputation in domestic and global market.</li>
