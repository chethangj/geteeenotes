            <h3>Armature reaction:</h3>
            <p>The interaction between the main flux and secondary flux produced due to the armature conductor is called armature reaction.</p>
            <p>The flux due to main pole is main flux however current flowing through armature conductor also creates a magnetic flux or armature flux.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/dcm/armature_reaction.png" alt="Armature Reaction" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;">
            </div>
            <h3>MNA (Magnetic Neutral Axis):</h3>
            <p>The axis along which there is no emf induced in the armature conductor is called magnetic neutral axis.</p>
            <h3>GNA (Geometric Neutral Axis):</h3>
            <p>It can be seen that the magnetic neutral axis and GNA coincides with each other.</p>
            <p>This weakness of the flux created by the poles and main poles this action of armature flux secondary flux on main flux is known as armature reaction.</p>
            <p>The effects of armature reactions are,</p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>Demagnetizing reaction effect</li>
                <li>Cross magnetizing effect</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Demagnetizing effect:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/dcm/demagnatizing_effect.png" alt="Demagnetizing effect" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;">
            </div>
            <p>The brushes are lying along the new position of MNA which is at angle θ from GNA due to armature reaction.</p>
            <p>The conductor is in the region AOC=BOD=2o at the top and bottom of the armature are carry I in such a direction as to send the flux in armature from right to left. These conductors are in direct opposition to main field is called demagnetizing armature conductor.</p>
            <h3>Cross magnetizing effect:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/dcm/crossmagnatizing_effect.png" alt="Cross magnetizing effect" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;">
            </div>
            <p>The remaining armature conductor which are laying in the region AOD and BOC carry current in such a direction as to send the flux point vertically downwards at right angles to the main field flux. These conductors are called cross magnetizing armature conductor.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the demagnetization F<sub>D</sub> is opposite direction to F<sub>f</sub> which is main field MMF direction.</li>
                <li>In cross magnetization F<sub>C</sub> is parallel in cross direction to F<sub>f</sub> which is in main field MMF direction.</li>
                <li>For demagnetization ampere turns per pole is,
                <div style="overflow-x: auto">
                    \[{A_{TD}}/pole = \frac{{\theta m}}{{360}} \times Z \times I\]
                </div></li>
                <li>For cross magnetization ampere turns per pole is,
                <div style="overflow-x: auto">
                    \[{A_{TC}}/pole = Z \times I\left[ {\frac{1}{{2P}} - \frac{{\theta m}}{{360}}} \right]\]
                </div></li>
                <p>Where,<br>Z = Total no. of armature conductors.<br>I = Current through armature conductor.<br>θm = Forward load angle in mechanical.</p>
            </ul>
            <p>The MNA is shifted through an angle θ in order to archive sparkles commutation the brush must be along the MNA consequently the brushes will be shifted to an angle θ.</p>
            <h3>Derivation of demagnetization and cross magnetization of ampere turns:</h3>
            <p>I = Current through armature conductor.<br>I = \(\frac{{{I_A}}}{2}\) for wave winding.<br>I=\(\frac{{{I_A}}}{P}\) for lap winding.</p>
            <p>The conductors are the responsible for demagnetizing ampere turns are laying in the region 4θm degrees. The region in the angle between AOC and DOB therefore number of armature conductor laying in the angle AOC and BOD</p>
            \[ = \frac{{4\theta m}}{{360}} \times Z\]
            <p>Therefore, two conductor = one turn.</p>
            <p>Total number of turns in this angle</p>
            \[ = \frac{1}{2}\frac{{4\theta m}}{{360}} \times Z\]
            \[ = \frac{{2\theta m}}{{360}} \times Z\]
            <p>Therefore demagnetization ampere turns</p>
            \[{A_{TD}} = \frac{{2\theta m}}{{360}} \times ZI\]
            <p>For two poles as shown in the diagram the flux per pole divided by 2.</p>
            \[{A_{TD}} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{{2\theta m}}{{360}} \times Z \times I\]
            \[{A_{TD}} = \frac{{\theta m}}{{360}} \times ZI\]
            <p>For cross magnetization ampere turns are laying between the angle AOD and VOC as shown in the diagram.</p>
            <p>Total armature conductor per pole = \(\frac{{{Z}}}{P}\).</p>
            <p>The expression for demagnetization conductor per pole</p>
            \[ = Z \times \frac{{2\theta m}}{{360}}\]
            <p>Therefore, cross magnetization conductor per pole Z/P.</p>
            \[\frac{Z}{P} = Z\frac{{2\theta m}}{{360}}\]
            \[] = Z\left[ {\frac{1}{P}.\frac{{2\theta m}}{{360}}} \right]\]
            <p>Therefore cross magnetize ampere turns/pole</p>
            \[ = ZI\left[ {\frac{1}{P}.\frac{{2\theta m}}{{360}}} \right]\]
            <h3>Effects of armature reaction:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Due to demagnetization and cross magnetization effect it reduces value of flux per pole.</li>
                <li>Due to reduction in the flux the value of generated emf also decreases.</li>
                <li>Due to distraction in main field flux maximum density load increases no load which increases the iron loss on the load.</li>
                <li>The voltage adjacent commutator segment increases on load due to the armature reaction. This can cause sparking between adjacent commutator segments.</li>
                <li>The armature reaction shift brush axis from GNA which makes commutation different.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Commutation:</h3>
            <p>The armature conductors carrying current in one direction when they are under North Pole and in opposite direction when they are in South Pole. The reversal of current is along the brush axis is called commutation.</p>
            <p>The period of time during which the coil remains short circuit is called commutation period.</p>
            <p>The reversal will not takes place within the commutation period this result in sparking at the brushes take place at the brushes is called poor commutation.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/dcm/commutation.png" alt="commutation" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            </div>
            <p>The complete reversal of current in a coil at a rate as the coil passes the brush is known as ideal commutation.</p>
            <p>If the current reversal is not completed within the commutation period the sparking across or between commutator segment and brushes which results sparking commutation.</p>
            <p>The sparking commutation may damage both the brush and the commutator segment.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/dcm/sparking_commutation.png" alt="sparking commutation" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            </div>
            <h3>Reactance voltage:</h3>
            <p>The self-induced emf in the coil undergoing commutation is called reactance voltage.</p>
            <p>The reactance voltage for linear commutation is given by,</p>
            <div style="overflow-x: auto">
                \[{R_V} = L \times \frac{{2I}}{{{T_C}}}\]
            </div>
            <h3>Sinusoidal commutation:</h3>
            <p>To reduce the sparking it is desirable to commutation during the initial movement and to accelerate it at latest stage of commutation this is known as sinusoidal commutation.</p>
            <div style="overflow-x: auto">
                \[self\;induced\;voltage = 1.11 \times L \times \frac{{2I}}{{{T_C}}}\]
            </div>
            <h3>Reasons for poor commutation:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Due to incorrect neutral position of the brushes.</li>
                <li>High reactance voltage.</li>
                <li>High reactance of the coil.</li>
                <li>Problems with the inter pole.</li>
                <li>Used of short pitch coils.</li>
                <li>Bent brush holder studs.</li>
                <li>Variation in the brush contact resistance.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Methods for improving the commutation:</h3>
            <p>There are two ways to improve the commutation.</p>
            <h4>1. Resistance method commutation:</h4>
            <p>If the contact resistance between the brush and commutator segment is made high this is archive by carbon brushes which have high contact resistance. This method of improving commutation is called resistance method commutation.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/dcm/resistance_commutation.png" alt="resistance commutation" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            </div>
            <p>There are two parallel paths to current as long as short circuit exists some of current takes second path. Sum of current will take through the short circuited coil. Then the segment B and to the brush because the contact area of the brush and segment A is smaller than the segment B because as the segment B passes the contact resistance R2 increases during decreasing the current contact area of B.</p>
            <p>At the same time the contact area of segment A increases.</p>
            <p>Hence the contact resistance R1 decreases allow the current to take path through the segment A until the current in the short circuited coil become zero.</p>
            <p>As the commutation advance the contact area of segment B reduces the current to take the path of least resistance hence the high contact resistance helps the current attaining its full value in the reverse direction and having good commutation.</p>
            <h4>Advantages of resistance commutation:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Upto some degree they are self-lubricating and polish the commutator.</li>
                <li>If sparking occurs damage to commutator will be less as compare to when copper brushes are used.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Disadvantages of resistance commutation:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>There is a loss of approximately 2 V due to high contact resistance. Hence this is not used in small machines.</li>
                <li>If carbon brushes are used to commutator is required to be made some large for dissipation without rise in temperature which is not necessary for copper brushes.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2. EMF commutation:</h4>
            <p>In emf commutation the reactance voltage produced is neutralize by the reversing emf produced in short circuit coil is called emf commutation.</p>
            <p>There are two methods of emf commutation.</p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>i.	Brush shifting</li>
                <li>ii.	Inter poles</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>i. Brush shifting:</h4>
            <p>The brushes are shifted backward or forward depending on the generator or motor. A little behind of magnetic neutral axis the short circuited coil will come under the influence of the main pole of opposite polarity. This method is rarely used in practice as it will lead to many practical difficulties.</p>
            <h4>ii. Inter poles:</h4>
            <p>The inter poles are fixed to yoke between the main pole. The winding carries some current as they are connected in series.</p>
            <p>The basic function of inter poles are,</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The polarity is same as the main poles.</li>
                <li>The emf induce opposes the reactive voltage.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Advantages of inter poles:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>With inter pole sparkles commutation upto 20 to 30% over load with fixed brush position can be obtained.</li>
                <li>The machine can be made smaller and will be cheaper than non-inter pole machines.</li>
                <li>Automatic neutralization or reactance voltage at all loads is ensured since it is connected in series with armature and reversing emf is proportional to armature current.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Characteristics of DC generator:</h3>
            <p>The important characteristics of DC generators are,</p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>Open circuit characteristics</li>
                <li>Internal characteristics or total characteristics</li>
                <li>External characteristics or load characteristics</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>i. Open circuit characteristics:</h3>
            <p>The relation between generated emf at no load and field current (I<sub>F</sub>) at constant speed id known as open circuit characteristics (OCC).</p>
            <h4>OCC for separately excited generator of DC:</h4>
            <p>The field winding of DC generator is excited by a separate independent DC source and the generator runs at constant speed the arrangement as shown in the diagram.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/dcm/OC_Char.png" alt="OC Char" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">

            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/dcm/OC_Char_graph.png" alt="OC Char" style="width: 100%; max-width: 300px;">
            </div>
            <p>The field current IF increases from 0 in steps and the corresponding value of generated emf (Eg) is noted.</p>
            <p>The graph between the Eg and I<sub>F</sub> are plotted. The curve starts from A due to residual magnetism in the poles. The curve is linear upto point B because of less reluctance after point B. the reluctance is maximum and the curve is nonlinear at point O. the magnetic saturation of poles takes place and the generated emf remains constant.</p>
            <h3>ii) Internal and external characteristics of separately excited DC generator:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/dcm/internal_external_char_of_DC_separately_excited_generator.png" alt="Internal and external characteristics of separately excited DC generator" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">

            </div>
            <p>The arrangement for internal and external separately excited DCC generator is as shown in the diagram.</p>
            <p>It is the graph plotted between voltage and current. The armature reaction reduces the main flux so that the emf generated at no load is less than generated emf. There is a voltage drop across the armature resistance due to which the external characteristics are dropping characteristics.</p>
            <p>The internal characteristics can be determined from the external characteristics by adding IARA drop to the external characteristics.</p>
            <h3>Characteristics of DC shunt generator:</h3>

            <h3>Open circuit characteristics or no load characteristics:</h3>
            <p>When the generator runs at rated speed it will build up a voltage OM represent the rated voltage at no load the terminal voltage of shunt generator will be constant and represented by a horizontal line MC parallel to x axis.</p>
            <h3>Internal characteristics:</h3>
            <p>When the generator is loaded the flux per pole is reduce due to armature reaction therefore the voltage on no load is less than the generated emf as results internal characteristics. Drop down slightly the line MB represent the internal characteristics.</p>
            <h3>External characteristics:</h3>
            <p>The external characteristics will be below the internal characteristics. The terminal voltage will be less due to voltage drop across the armature and field winding. The line MA represents the external characteristics.</p>

            </div>
            <p>In critical field resistance as that the resistance of the field circuit at a given speed at which generator just exists and starts voltage building while behind this value generator fails to exist.</p>
            <p>The critical resistance is the slope of the critical resistance line.</p>
            <div style="overflow-x: auto">
                \[{R_C} = \frac{{\Delta E}}{{\Delta {I_f}}} = \frac{{DE}}{{CD}} = \tan \theta \]
            </div>
            <p>If field critical resistance is more than RC at start then emf induced is failed to drive current through field circuit and generator fail to excite at given speed.</p>
            <h3>Conditions for voltage build up for shunt generator:</h3>
            <p>The necessary conditions for voltage build up are,</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There must be residual magnetism in the poles of generator.</li>
                <li>The field winding connection should strengthen the residual magnetism.</li>
                <li>The resistance of field circuit should be less than critical field resistance on no load.</li>

            <h3>Causes for failure of voltage build up:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The residual magnetism may be zero.</li>
                <li>The residual magnetism may be in reverse polarity.</li>
                <li>The field winding terminals may be reverse.</li>
                <li>The field winding resistance may be greater than the critical field resistance.</li>

            <h3>Losses in DC generator and Efficiency:</h3>
            <h4>Copper loss:</h4>
            <p>The copper losses occur due to the flow of current in various winding of DC generator.</p>
            <p>The different types of copper losses are,</p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>Armature copper losses (I<sup>2</sup><sub>A</sub>R<sub>A</sub>)</li>
                <li>Series field copper losses (I<sup>2</sup><sub>se</sub>R<sub>se</sub>)</li>
                <li>Shunt field copper losses (I<sup>2</sup><sub>sh</sub>R<sub>sh</sub>)</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Iron losses:</h4>
            <p>The iron losses in the armature are due to the rotation of armature in the magnetic field.</p>
            <p>There are two types of iron losses.</p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>Hysteresis losses</li>
                <li>Eddy current losses</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>i. Hysteresis losses:</h4>
            <p>The inter molecular friction in the magnet of armature cores leads to some amount of power losses is known as hysteresis losses.</p>
            <p>Therefore,</p>
            <div style="overflow-x: auto">
                \[Hysteresis\;Losses = \eta B_{max}^2f.V\]
            </div>
            <p>Where,<br>B = maximum flux density.<br>F = Frequency.<br>V = Volume of armature.</p>
            <h4>ii. Eddy current losses:</h4>
            <p>When the current passes through the armature core due to the voltage induced, the losses due to circulating current is called eddy current losses.</p>
            <div style="overflow-x: auto">
                \[Eddy\;Current\;Losses = kB_{max}^2f \times V \times t\]
            </div>
            <p>Where,<br>K = constant<br>T = thickness of the lamination.</p>
            <p>In order to reduce the eddy current losses the armature core is made up of thin lamination.</p>
            <h4>Mechanical losses:</h4>
            <p>The losses due to friction are called mechanical losses.</p>
            <p>The friction losses are due to various frictions such as brush and commutator, air friction.</p>
            <h3>Power stage of DC generator:</h3>
            <p>The efficiency of DC generator is magnetism when variable losses equal to constant losses.</p>
            \[Variable\;losses = Constant\;losses\]

            <h3>Voltage regulation:</h3>
            <p>The variation of terminal voltage from no load to full load is called voltage regulation.</p>
            <p>The voltage regulation is always expressed in percentage (%) therefore,</p>
            <div style="overflow-x: auto">
                \[\% regulation = \frac{{{V_{NL}} - {V_{FL}}}}{{{V_{FL}}}} \times 100\]
