            <h3 id="intro">Introduction:</h3>
            <p>Management is the technique and process of planning, organizing, arranging materials, financial, human and other require resources for sel ecting, supervising, monitoring to achieve the objectives. Energy management is important to reduce the consumption and valuable resources.</p>
            <h3>Meaning of Energy Management:</h3>
            <p>Energy management is the process of monitoring, controlling and conserving energy in the organization.</p>
            <h3>Significance of Energy Management:</h3>
            <p>The increasing population, transport and standard of leaving, the demand for energy is increasing while available resources for energy are less. Now a days energy is considered as important source for industry, transportation, agriculture, commercial and domestic purpose.</p>
            <h3>Importance of Energy Management:</h3>
            <p>Energy should be considered as business cost, like raw materials or labour. Companies can achieve reduction in energy bills by implementing simple house keeping method. By this method they can achieve,</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Reduces Cost:</b> most of the organization can save up to 20% by managing the energy use.</li>
                <li><b>Reduces Carbon Emissions:</b> If reducing energy consumption is also reduces the carbon emission and environmental effects.</li>
                <li><b>Develop Green Image:</b> By reducing carbon emission it will helps to build a green image and generating good business opportunities.</li>
                <li><b>Reduce Risk:</b> Reducing energy helps to reduce risk of energy cost fluctuations.</li>
                <li><b>Utilizing Energy Resources:</b> Energy management involves utilizing the available energy resources more effectively that is minimum cost.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="energy-conservation">Energy Conservation:</h3>
            <p>Energy conservation means to reduce the quantity of energy that is used for different purposes. This practice may results in increase of financial capital, environmental value, national and personal security and human comfort.</p>
            <h3>Need of Energy Conservation:</h3>
            <p>The followings are the needs of energy conservation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Energy conservation result in increased financial capital, environmental quality, national security, personal security and human comfort.</li>
                <li>Energy conservation is a single step which can effectively contribute towards reduction of storages.</li>
                <li>If everyone started saving energy then cost of leaving can be save.</li>
                <li>When you decrease the amount of energy you used, automatically it reduces the global warming.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="objectives-em">Objectives of Energy Management:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Primary goal of energy management is profit optimization or cost minimization.</li>
                <li>Energy management is to achieve and maintain optimum energy procurement and utilization throughout the organization.</li>
                <li>To minimize energy costs.</li>
                <li>Energy management maintains the quality and production without affecting.</li>
                <li>To minimize environmental effects.</li>
                <li>Energy management is to produce goods and provide services with the least cost.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Methodology or Strategies of Energy Management:</h3>

            </ol>
            <h4>i.	Self-knowledge and awareness among the people:</h4>
            <p>For the successful energy management the knowledge of process and machines for the operator is very important. As per the technique the operator understand the cost benefit of energy conservation.</p>
            <h4>ii.	Re-engineering and evaluation:</h4>
            <p>Once the awareness is establish it needs to start evaluation of process. It may understand the motor capacity, types of starters employed and nature of loads.</p>

                <li>Energy resources are comparatively limited.</li>
                <li>Most of the energy sources are not re-used and renewed.</li>
                <li>When energy is saved then lot of money saved in the country.</li>
                <li>Energy will save then money will save.</li>
                <li>Energy saved is energy generated. When we save 1 unit of energy, it is equivalent to 2 units of energy produced.</li>
                <li>Saved energy results in reducing the pollution.</li>
                <li>It is essential to conserve today for tomorrows use.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="e-crisis">Energy Crisis:</h3>
