        <h2>CHAPTER 03 : PROTECTIVE RELAYS</h2>
            <h3>Relay:</h3>
            <p>It is a protective device which senses the abnormal condition or fault section in a part of the power system and gives alarm to isolate the fault section from the healthy section. The relays are compact self-contained devices which response only during abnormal conditions.</p>
            <h3>Operation of relay:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/sgp/Relay_Circuit.png" alt="Relay Circuit" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            </div>
            <p>The relay is a protective device which detects the fault and indicates the operation of circuit breakers to isolate the faulty section from the healthy section which is shown in the above figure.</p>
            <p>Relay circuit connection is mainly divided into three parts.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Primary winding of current transformer in which is connected series with the line protected.</li>
                <li>The second part consists of secondary winding of current transformer, relay operating coil.</li>
                <li>The third part is the tripping circuit which may be either AC or DC. It consists of source or supply to the tripping coil of the circuit breaker and also the relay stationary contacts.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>When a short circuit occurs at a fault point (F) on the transmission line the current flowing in the line increases to an abnormal amount which results in the flow of high current to the relay operating coil due to this it closes the contacts which in term close the trip circuit of the circuit breaker and tripping coil is energized.</p>
            <p>Hence the circuit breaker contacts will starts to open and isolate the faulty section from the healthy section. In this way the relay is operated as safety equipment and avoids the damage during abnormal condition and can be operated normally during normal condition.</p>
            <h3>The required qualities of protective relays or the fundamental requirements of relay:</h3>
            <h4>1) Selectivity:</h4>
            <p>It is the ability of protective system to select correctly the part of the system. When system is in trouble it disconnects the faulty part without disturbing the remaining part of the system.</p>
            <h4>2) Sensitivity:</h4>
            <p>Relay must be sufficiently sensitive to operate under minimum fault condition. The really must be reliable within its zone and it should remain stable under maximum load or fault condition.</p>
            <h4>3) Simplicity:</h4>
            <p>The protective relay system must be kept as simple as possible during normal and abnormal conditions.</p>
            <h4>4) Speed:</h4>
            <p>It is design in the protective system to isolate a trouble zone as rapidly as possible. A speed relay will operate less than 50 mili sec.</p>
            <h4>5) Reliability:</h4>
            <p>Reliability is having mainly to aspects.</p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>Dependability</li>
                <li>Security</li>
            </ol>
            <p><b>i) Dependability:</b> It indicates the ability of the power system to perform when correctly required.</p>
            <p><b>ii) Security:</b> It is the ability to avoid unnecessary operation during normal condition and also whenever the fault occurs.</p>
            <h4>6) Economy:</h4>
            <p>Economy of the system is to obtain maximum protection with minimum cost.</p>
            <h3>Important Terms:</h3>
            <h4>1) Pick-up current or pick-up value:</h4>
            <p>It is minimum current in the relay coil at which the relay will start to operate. (As long as the current in the relay is less than the pick-up current, then the relay will not operate.)</p>
            <h4>2) Current Setting:</h4>
            <p>The pick-up value of current can be adjusted to the required level in the relays which is called as current setting of relay.</p>
            <p>This can be archived by the use of tapings on the relay.</p>
            <h4>5) PSM (Plug Setting Multiplier):</h4>
            <p>It is the ration of fault current to the pick-up current of the relay.</p>
            <div style="overflow-x: auto">
                \[{\rm{PSM}} = \frac{{{\rm{Fault\;Current\;in\;Relay}}}}{{{\rm{Pick}} - {\rm{up\;Current}}}}\]
            </div>
            <h4>6) TSM (Time Setting Multiplier):</h4>
            <p>A relay is provided with features with which its time of operation can be controlled. This feature is known as TSM.</p>
            <div style="overflow-x: auto">
                \[Actual\;Time\;of\;Operation = Time\;in\;sec \times TSM\]
            </div>
            <h3>Time v/s PSM Current:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/sgp/Time_vs_PSM_Current.png" alt="Time v/s PSM Current" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            </div>
            <p>The curve shows the relation between times versus PSM current. It can be absorb that for low values of current. The operating time is inversely proportional. But the current increases which opposes upto 20 times than the rated current then the time becomes constant.</p>
            <p>This type of characteristics is necessary to ensure discrimination on very high fault current flowing through the healthy part of the system.</p>
            <h3>Classification of protective relay (or) different types of protective relay:</h3>
            <p>Based on the relay operating characteristics it is classified into different types are as follows.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Solenoid Type</li>
                <li>Attracted Armature Type</li>
                <li>Electromagnetic Type</li>
                <li>Moving Coil Type</li>
                <li>Induction Type</li>
                <li>Direction or Reverse Current Type</li>
                <li>Directional or Reverse Power Type</li>
                <li>Under Voltage, Under Current Relay</li>
                <li>Over Current and Over Voltage Relay</li>
                <li>Thermal Relay</li>
                <li>Differential Relay</li>
                <li>Distance Relay</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Primary and Backup Protection:</h3>
            <h4>Primary Protection:</h4>
            <p>The power system protection scheme is designed to protect the power system parts and components. If the fault occurs it is cleared by the relay and circuit breakers. This is called as main protection or primary protection.</p>
            <p>But in some cases the fault is not eliminated by the primary or main protection in the system that is the circuit breakers and relay system may be having some trouble at different conditions. In those conditions secondary or backup protection is necessary.</p>
            <p>Primary protection may fail due to the following reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Failure of DC supply to the tripping circuit.</li>
                <li>Failure in relay operating current or voltage.</li>
                <li>Failure in circuit breaker tripping mechanism.</li>
                <li>Failure in the wiring of relaying system.</li>
                <li>Failure of main protective relay operation.</li>
                <li>Failure of CT’s or PT’s operation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Secondary (or) Backup Protection:</h4>
            <p>Backup protection is very important for stable and reliable power system. It is not possible to design 100% secure and efficient system because there are possibilities of failure in the connected CT’s and PT’s etc., in the system. If it happens then it will destroy whole switching system.</p>
            <p>If the primary protection fails to operate then the secondary protection will disconnects the faulty part from the system. Backup protection may be operated automatically with the help of some additional equipment.</p>
            <p>Example: Over current or distance protection schemes are provided to give backup protection.</p>
            <h3>Induction type Non-Directional Over Current Relay:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/sgp/Induction_Type_Non_Directional_Over_Current_Relay.png" alt="Induction type Non-Directional Over Current Relay" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;">
            </div>
            <p><b>Construction:</b></p>
            <p>An Aluminium disc is connected between the poles of two electromagnets. The upper magnet has both primary and secondary windings. The primary winding is connected to the secondary of CT and it is also connected to the tapings of plug setting bridge. This gives numbers of turns of relay operating coil.</p>
            <p><b>Working:</b></p>
            <p>The deflecting torque is produces in the disc due to the interaction of magnets which induces flus ∅<sub>1</sub> and ∅<sub>2</sub> due to the current (I) in the disc. This torque is opposed by the controlling torque which is provided by the hair springs.</p>
            <p>Under normal operating condition, the controlling torque is greater than the deflecting torque produced by the relay coil current. (T<sub>C</sub>>T<sub>D</sub>). Therefore aluminium disc remains stationary.</p>
            <p>During abnormal condition, the current exceeds the preset value then the deflecting torque becomes greater than controlling torque hence the disc rotates between the moving contacts, bridge and fixed contact. When the disc rotates through a preset angle the trip circuit starts to operate and the circuit breaker will disconnect the fault or isolate the faulty section from the healthy section.</p>
            <h3>Static Relays:</h3>
            <p>The relays which do not have any moving parts but these relays are having only solid state electronic components such as diodes, transistors etc., are called static relays. The circuit has components level detectors, zero crossing detectors etc., and is design using electronic components in the static relays for measurement and comparison of electrical quantities.</p>
            <p>The static relay is designed in such a way that whenever a quantity under consideration exceeds a certain particular value, the static circuit produces a response without any moving parts such as armature. This response is then manipulated and given to the tripping circuit. The tripping circuit may be either electronic or electromagnetic. “Thus the static relay response circuit does not have moving parts and made up of electronic components, but its tripping circuit may be electronic or electromagnetic.”</p>
            <h3>Static Type Over Current Relay:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/sgp/Static_Type_Over_Current_Relay.png" alt="Static Type Over Current Relay" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;">
            </div>
            <p>The secondary of the line CT’s are connected to the summation circuit. The output of the summation CT is given to the input CT with filter. Thus input CT is called auxiliary CT which has tapings on the primary for selecting the required pick-up current range. Then the output of auxiliary CT is rectified and smoothened. It is then applied to the overload level detector and RC timing circuit. When the voltage across the timing capacitor reaches to a certain value then it triggers level detector. The output of the level detector is amplified as per the requirement and given to the tripping circuit.</p>
            <p>The charging of capacitor in a timing circuit is archived by a voltage derived from CT current.</p>
            <p>The current at which the level detector trips is called threshold current. It is denoted by I<sub>Threshold</sub>. Thus for an static type over current relay,</p>
            <p>When,</p>
            <p>I<sub>in</sub> < I<sub>Threshold</sub> = level detector will not trip.<br>If I<sub>in</sub> ≥ I<sub>Threshold</sub> = level detector will trip.</p>
            <h4>Advantages of Static Relays:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The moving parts are absent. The moving parts are present only in the actual tripping circuit and not in a control circuit.</li>
                <li>The power consumption is very low as most of the circuits are electronic.</li>
                <li>This gives very quick response.</li>

            </ul>
            <h4>Limitations of Static Relays:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The characteristics of electronic components such as transistor, diodes, transducers etc. are temperature depended hence relay characteristics may vary with temperature and aging.</li>
                <li>These relays have low short time over load capacity compare ti the electromagnetic relay.</li>
                <li>Additional DC supply is required for various transistor circuits.</li>
                <li>Less robust compare to the electromagnetic relays.</li>
            </ul>

            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/sgp/Microprocessor_Based_Over_Current_Relay.png" alt="Microprocessor based over current relay" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;">
            </div>
            <p>The above figure shows the block diagram of microprocessor based relay. The microprocessor is a programmable unit. The secondary of the current transformer is given to the input of receiver block where signal is processed (signal processing unit). This signal processing includes surge protectors, rectifiers, smoothing filters, axillary current transformer etc. depending upon the requirement. This signal is an analog signal. The ADC converts this to a digital signal which is accepted by the microprocessor. The microprocessor is decision making block.</p>
            <p>The digital output signal is compared with the reference to generate the proper tripping signal. This is a digital signal which is converted into analog again to operate tripping coil. This can be archived by DAC. The data logger captures the data (stores the data) and feeds it to the microprocessor when there is a request from the microprocessor. This information can be displayed with proper display device by taking signal from the microprocessor.</p>
            <p>The one microprocessor based relay can perform multi functions. (One unit can perform the relying operation of several systems.)</p>
            <h4>Advantages:</h4>

                <li>One unit can perform relying of several systems.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Applications of microprocessor base over current relay:</h4>

            <h3>Numerical Relays:</h3>
            <p>A relay using computer or microprocessor for decision making based on digital numbers, representing instantaneous values of the signal is called numerical relay. It is also called as computer based relay.</p>
            <p>Numerical relay is invented in 1985. It is a programmable relay in which the characteristics and function can be program. Most of the numerical relays are multi-functional.</p>
            <h3>Construction and working of numerical relays:</h3>

            <img src="img/sgp/Construction_and_Working_of_Numerical_Relay.png" alt="Construction and working of numerical relays" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;">
            </div>
            <p>The above block diagram shows numerical relay. The voltage and current signals in the power system are brought down to the suitable level using CT and PT. these signals can’t be converted directly into digital form because it is having high frequency components. These high frequency components are converted into low frequency components using low pass filter. This process is called aliasing.</p>
            <p>Thus the signals from CT and PT are given to the antialiasing filters which are low pass filter. This removes unwanted frequency components. The signals from signal conditioning circuit are given to the sample and hold circuit and with the help of analog multiplexer and analog to digital converter, the equipment digital signal is obtained. The analog multiplexer gives the facility to accommodate large number of input signals and single output signal.</p>
            <p>The digital output of ADC is sent to the microprocessor or microcontroller where it is stored in the memory. The digital signal is processed with the help of numerical relay in algorithm and according to the obtained output, trip decision is made. The trip signal is in the form of digital signal hence it is converted into analog signal using DAC. Thus the tripping analog signal is given to the trip coil of the circuit breaker.</p>
            <p>The data logger captures the data and feeds it to the microprocessor when there is a request from the microprocessor.</p>
            <h4>Advantages of numerical relays:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>It uses electronic components or circuits for functioning hence compact is size.</li>
                <li>The numerical relay can be made multifunctional with the suitable modifications in the software and hardware.</li>
                <li>It is having less internal connections hence reduce component failure hence it is more reliable.</li>
                <li>It has very least resulting time.</li>
                <li>It is very economical for large power system.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Disadvantages of numerical relays:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Proper care of earthing must be taken.</li>
                <li>It has a risk of hacking.</li>
                <li>It is multifunctional the failure of one element will effect complete system.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Relay:</h3>
            <p>In over current relays which are sensitive and which can’t distinguish between heavy fault and minor fault condition. In order to overcome these difficulties the differential relays are used.</p>
            <p>It is used to operate when two or more electrical quantities exceeds its pre defines value then differential relay will operate. On the result it compares the phase differences or phase angle and magnitude of the current between the entering section and the current leaving section.</p>
            <p>Under normal condition both the currents are equal in magnitude and phase angle hence the relay will not operate. It is connected in such a manner that the difference between the entering current and leaving current flows through the relay operating coil. If this difference in current exceeds a preset value then the relay will start to operate and open the circuit breaker to isolate from the fault section.</p>
            <h3>Types of differential relay:</h3>
            <p>Differential relays are broadly classified into three types.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Current differential relay</li>
                <li>Voltage balance differential relay</li>
                <li>Biased beam differential relay or percentage differential relay</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>1) Current Differential Relay:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/sgp/Current_Differential_Relay_External_Fault.png" alt="Current Differential Relay" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            <p><cite>Fig (a): Differential relay with external fault.</cite></p>
            </div>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/sgp/Current_Differential_Relay_Internal_Fault.png" alt="Current Differential Relay" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            <p><cite>Fig (b): Differential relay with internal fault.</cite></p>
            </div>
            <p>Most of the differential relays are current differential relays. To operate the current differential relay the two CT’s which are having same ratio are connected on either side of the section to be protected which is shown in figure (a) and (b).</p>
            <p>The secondary of CT’s are connected in series with the relay operating coil. So they carry induced current in the same direction. Let current (I) is flowing through the primary of CT towards the external faults which is shown in figure (a). The CT is identical hence secondary of CT also carry equal current. Due to this no current will flow through the operating coil of relay. Hence relay will not operate.</p>
            <p>Consider now the fault is occurred internally at point A which is shown in fig (b). The current flows through the faults from either sides of CT are not equal. The current flowing through the relay operating coil is “I<sub>1</sub>+I<sub>2</sub>”. This high current causes the relay to operate and opens the circuit breaker.</p>
            <h3>2) Voltage Balance Differential Relay:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/sgp/Voltage_Balance_Differential_Relay.png" alt="Voltage Balance Differential Relay" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            </div>
            <p>In this type of protection system the two similar CT’s are connected on either ends of the elements (alternator windings) to be protected. These are connected with pilot cable. The secondary of CT’s are connected in series with the relay operating coil.</p>
            <p>Under normal working condition, the induced emf in the relay coil which opposes the flow of current. The equal currents close in both the secondary’s of CT. hence no current will flow through the relay operating coil.</p>
            <p>When faults over within the protective zone, the current in primary of two CT’s will vary from each other. Thus the secondary voltage is disturbed. This voltage difference will cause the effect of large current through the relay operating coil. This will close the trip circuit and circuit breaker starts the operation.</p>
            <h3>Definite Distance Impedance Relay:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/sgp/Definite_Distance_Impedance_Relay.png" alt="Definite Distance Impedance Relay" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;">
            </div>
            <p><b>Construction:</b></p>
            <p>It consists of a balanced beam which is pivoted at the center part ‘F’. The beam carries the armature of two electromagnets. The two electromagnets are energized by a current coil from current transformer and voltage from potential transformer. The voltage coil acts as the restraining coil, the current coil acts as operating coil. The beam also carries the moving and fixed contacts and two fixed contacts of trip circuit which is shown in above figure.</p>
            <p><b>Operation:</b></p>
            <p>The torques is produced in both the current coil and voltage coil. This torque is square of current (T<sub>1</sub>=k<sub>1</sub>I<sup>2</sup>) and square of voltage (T<sub>2</sub>=k<sub>2</sub>V<sup>2</sup>).</p>
            <p>Under normal working condition, the torque produced by the voltage coil (restraining coil) is greater than the torque produced by the current coil (operating coil). T<sub>2</sub>>T<sub>1</sub>. Hence the relay operates at inoperative region.</p>
            <p>Under abnormal condition, the voltage of the system decreases which increases the current. The ratio of V/I is also decreased hence the torque produced by the operating coil is greater than the torque produced by the voltage coil (restraining torque). (T<sub>2</sub><T<sub>1</sub>). Hence the relay starts to operate by closing the contacts of tripping circuit and opens the CB to isolate from the fault section.</p>
            <h3>Time Distance Impedance Relay:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/sgp/Time_Distance_Impedance_Relay.png" alt="Time Distance Impedance Relay" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;">
            </div>
            <p><b>Construction:</b></p>
            <p>This relay adjusts its time of operation corresponding to the distance of fault from the relay. The above figure shows the time distance impedance relay.</p>
            <p>It is consisting of an induction type over current relay unit which is a current driven element. The spindle which is carrying the disc of current element is connected to second element voltage driven element with the help of spiral spring coupling. The second spindle also carries a moving contact and two fixed contact which is connected to trip circuit. This contact closes only when the relay operates.</p>
            <p><b>Operation:</b></p>
            <p>Under normal condition, the force excreted by the voltage restraining magnet is greater than the force excreted by the over current induction element. Thus the trip contact remains constant and relay will not operate.</p>
            <p>Under fault condition, the induction disc starts to rotate. The speed of the disc is proportional to the operating current in the current element, neglecting the spring effect. Hence the time required rotating the disc, the angle varies inversely with current. As the disc rotates through which the spiral spring is wound which excretes a force on the armature to pull it away from the restraining magnet. Hence the moving contact closes the fixed contacts of the trip circuit. This will opens the CB to isolate the circuit from the fault section.</p>
            <h3>Necessity of protection:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The removal of fault component which is behaving abnormal by closing the trip circuit of the circuit breaker or to be sound alarm.</li>
                <li>To disconnect the abnormally operating part so as to avoid the damage or interference with in the effective operation of the rest of the system.</li>
                <li>To prevent the subsequence faults b disconnecting the abnormally operating part.</li>
                <li>To disconnect the faulty section as quickly as possible so as to minimize the damage to the fault section.<br>
                For example, if there is fault in a winding part in a machine and if it is continuous for long time then there is a damage of the remaining equipments or entire winding but if it is disconnected quickly only few coils may get damaged instead of the entire winding.</li>
                <li>To improve the system performance, system reliability, system ability and service continuity.</li>
                <li>To restrict the spreading of the effect of faults causing less damage to the rest of the healthy section.</li>
            </ul>
