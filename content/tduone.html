            </div>
            <h4>Generating Station:</h4>
            <p>In generating station mechanical energy is converted into an electrical energy by using three phase parallel operated alternators. The voltage of generation is 6.6 KV, 11 KV or 33 KV. For simplicity or economy power is generated at 11 KV.</p>
            <h4>Primary Transmission:</h4>
            <p>After generating voltage at 11 KV it is raised to 220 KV by using step up transformer and sent to long distance transmission called high voltage primary transmission is carried out by three phase three wire overhead lines.</p>
            <h4>Secondary Transmission:</h4>
            <p>The power at 220 KV is received at receiving station and the voltage is reduced to 33 KV by using step down transformer after this the 33 KV power is supplied to different substations is called secondary transmission.</p>
            <h4>Primary Distribution:</h4>
            <p>The power at 33 KV is brought to another substation. Here the voltage is reduced to 11 KV by using step down transformer and distributed along the major roads of the city and individual industry called primary distribution.</p>
            <h4>Secondary Distribution:</h4>
            <p>The power from 11 KV line is brought to distribution substations which is located near the consumer localities and the voltage from 11 KV is reduced to AC 440 V between the lines and 230 V between phase and neutral. This is the consumer standard rated voltage which is distributed in all the streets of the cities called secondary distribution.</p>

            <h3>Limitations of high voltage transmission system:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The corona loss is greatly influenced by transmission voltage. There is also interference of radio which causes disturbances.</li>
                <li>In order to protect the transmission line during cyclones and storms  and make it wind resistance extra amount of metal is require for the line supports which may increases the cost.</li>
                <li>With increase in transmission voltage insulation required for line conductors also increases which increases its cost.</li>
                <li>It required high standard of workmanship for supporting structures are to be efficiently transported.</li>
                <li>The cost of transformer, switchgear equipments increases with increase in transmission line voltage.</li>
                <li>The high voltage line generates electrostatic effects which are harmful to human beings also to animals.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Advantages of high voltage transmission:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Greater in the transmission voltage level, lesser in the volume of copper require for the conductors of transmission line.</li>
                <li>Greater in the transmission voltage level, higher in the efficiency of transmission.</li>
                <li>Greater in the transmission voltage level, percentage of transmission line voltage drop is less.</li>
                <li>As voltage drop on the transmission line reduces the voltage regulation of the line gets improved.</li>
                <li>Higher transmission voltage level increases the power handling capacity of the line.</li>
                <li>The land requirement reduces as transmission voltage increases.</li>

            <h3>Explain Transmission by Overhead System:</h3>
            <p>In overhead transmission system a bare conductors that is ACSR is placed or the minimum level by using poles or steal structures. The porcelain made insulators are used to insulate current carrying conductors from other accessories of the poles.</p>
            <h3>Explain Transmission by underground System:</h3>
            <p>In metropolitan cities where overhead transmission and distribution is impossible then insulated cable can be laid bellow the ground level and is called UG System. The UG system reduces the chances of accidents and improves appearance.</p>

            <h3>AC and DC Transmission System:</h3>
            <h4>Advantages of AC Transmission System:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>AC power can be generated at high voltages easily.</li>
                <li>Transformers can be used for changing the voltage level which is easier.</li>
                <li>The maintenance of AC substation is cheap.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Disadvantages of AC Transmission System:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Amount of conductor material required is more.</li>
                <li>Large AC transmission produces continuous power loess.</li>
                <li>Construction is complicated than DC line.</li>
                <li>To avoid corona losses and to provide adequate insulation the spacing between the line conductors is more.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Advantages of DC Transmission System:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>In Dc transmission requires only 2 conductors.</li>
                <li>In DC there is no problem of inductance, capacitance and phase displacement.</li>
                <li>Corona loss in DC is less.</li>
                <li>Voltage regulation will be better.</li>
                <li>Insulation required is less.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Disadvantages of DC Transmission System:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Transformers cannot be used for step up and step down.</li>
                <li>The switches and circuit breakers used for DC have their own limitations.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Applications of Transmission Systems:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>AC system which is very commonly used for the transmission of power till substations and local distribution center is three phase 3 wire system.</li>
                <li>While for the secondary distribution the universal adapted AC system is three phase 4 wire system.</li>
                <li>For few applications like operation of DC motors, batteries, charging and welding where DC supply system is used.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Line Constants of Transmission Lines:</h3>
            <h4>Resistance:</h4>
            <p>It is the opposition offered by the transmission line conductors to the flow of current. The resistance is distributed along the whole length of the wire.</p>
            \[R = \int {\frac{l}{a}} \]
            <p>Where,<br>					∫= Specific Resistance<br>
					l = length of the conductor<br>
					a = area of cross section of conductor in m2</p>
            <p>The value of specific resistance depends upon the temperature of the line conductor. The transmission lines are subjected to temperature variations due to climatic changes, load variations etc.</p>
            <h4>Inductance:</h4>
            <p>When AC is supplied to transmission line, a changing flux is setup this links the conductors. Due to these flux linkages the conductor poses inductance.</p>
            <p>Inductance of an alternating current circuit is defined as flux linkages per unit ampere.</p>
            \[L = \;\frac{{N\emptyset }}{I}\]
            <p>Where,<br> 				N = no. of turns in the coil<br>
				∅ = flux in Webbers<br>
				I = current in ampere</p>
            <p>The inductance is also uniformly distributed along the length of the wire.</p>
            <h4>Capacitance:</h4>
            <p>Any two conductors separated by an insulating material consisting of capacitor. In overhead transmission line, lines are separated by air which acts as an insulation. Therefore capacitance exits between any two overhead line conductors.</p>
            <p>The capacitance is the charge per unit potential difference.</p>
            \[e = \;\frac{q}{v}\;farad\]
            <p>Where,<br>				q = charge on the line<br>
				V = potential difference between conductors
</p>
            <p>The capacitance is uniformly distributed along the whole length of the wire.</p>
            <p>Therefore the line constants R, L and C are uniformly distributed along the whole length of the wire.</p>

            <h3>Classification of Overhead Transmission Lines:</h3>
            <p>1.	Based on the distance</p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>Short transmission line</li>
                <li>Medium transmission line</li>
                <li>Long transmission line</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Short Transmission Line:</h4>
            <p>When the length of an OH transmission line is up to 80 km and the line voltage is comparatively low that is < 25 KV.</p>
            <p>Due to smaller length and lower voltage the capacitance effects are small and hence can be neglected. Therefore for short transmission line only resistance and inductance of the line are taking into account.</p>
            <h4>Medium Transmission Line:</h4>
            <p>When the length of an OH transmission line is about 80 to 250 km and the line voltage is moderately high that is >25 KV<100 KV and it is considered as a medium transmission line. In case of medium transmission line capacitance effect is also included but it is assumed that C is concentrated at 1 or 2 point in the line.</p>
            <h4>Long transmission Line:</h4>
            <p>When the length of an OH transmission line is more than 250 km and voltage is very high that is > 100 KV it is considered as a long transmission line.</p>
            <p>In case of long transmission, parameters R, L and C are distributed along the line.</p>

            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>In 3 phase overhead line, if line conductors are not equidistant from each other the conductor spacing is set to be asymmetrical.</li>
                <li>Under such conditions the flux linkage and inductance of each phase are not the same.</li>
                <li>A different inductance in each phase results in unequal voltage drops in the 3 phases even if the current in the conductors are balanced.</li>
                <li>Therefore the voltage at the receiving end will not be the same for all phases.</li>
                <li>In order to equal voltage drops in conductors it is necessary to interchange the positions of the conductors at regular intervals along the line so that each conductor occupies the original position. Such an exchange of position is known as transposition.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Transmission Efficiency:</h3>
            <p>The ratio of receiving end power to the sending end power of a transmission line is known as the transmission efficiency of the line.</p>
            <div style="overflow-x: auto">

            <h3>Voltage Regulation:</h3>
            <p>The difference in voltage at the receiving end of a transmission line between conditions of no load and full load is called voltage regulation and is expressed as a % of the receiving end voltage.</p>

            </div>
            <h3>Corona:</h3>
            <p>When the applied voltage between transmission line conductors exceeds a certain value called critical disruptive voltage, the conductors are surrounded by a faint violet glow. This phenomenon is known as corona.</p>
            <p>Or</p>
            <p>If we gradually increase the voltage applied across two conductors a stage will arrive a faint luminous glow of violet color will appear along with the hissing noise and finally a spark over take place. This is termed as corona.</p>
            <h3>Corona Formation:</h3>
            <p>In the free space surrounding the conductors, some ionization is always present due to radio activity cosmic rays and ultra violet rays. Thus the air near the conductors consists of some free electrons, ionized particles along with neutral molecules. When the voltage is applied to the conductors a potential gradient is developed in the air. Due to the potential gradient the free electrons will start moving with certain velocity. If applied voltage increases potential gradient increases which increases the velocity of free electrons. Hence ionization takes place which give rise to corona effect.</p>
            <h4>Advantages:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Due to corona formation the air surrounding the conductor becomes conducting and hence the virtual diameter of the conductor is increased. The increased diameter reduces the electrostatic stress between the conductors.</li>
                <li>Corona reduces the effect of transient produced by surges and conductor is saved from possibility of lightning. It acts as a safety device.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The corona power loss is the biggest disadvantage which reduces the transmission efficiency.</li>
                <li>The ozone gas formed due to corona chemically reacts with the conductor and can cause corrosion.</li>
                <li>The non-sinusoidal voltage drop which occurs in the line cause inductive interference with nearby communication lines.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Skin Effect:</h3>
            <p>The phenomena arising due to unequal distribution of current over the entire cross section of the conductor being used for long distance power transmission is referred as the skin effect in transmission lines.</p>
            <h3>Ferranti Effect:</h3>
            <p>A long transmission line has a large capacitance. If such a line is open circuited or connected to the very lite load at the receiving end the magnitude of the voltage at the receiving end becomes higher than the voltage at the sending end. This phenomenon is called Ferranti effect.</p>
            <h3>Material used in OH lines:</h3>
            <h4>Poles or towers:</h4>
            <p>The wooden, steel and RCC poles are used for low voltage distribution. Steel towers have the advantage of very long life with little maintenance. They are capable in all climatic conditions.</p>
            <p>The tower footings are efficiently grounded to reduce the chances of accidents due to atmospheric lightning. Due to their robust construction long span can be used and much useful for crossing field valleys, railways, river etc.</p>
            <h4>Conductors:</h4>
            <p>Conductors are one of the most important components of transmission and distribution. The proper selection of conductor and its size is essential for the point of economy and efficiency of transmission line. The conductor should have following properties.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Good conductivity.</li>
                <li>Low weight.</li>
                <li>Low cost.</li>
                <li>The material should be easily available.</li>
                <li>High tensile strength to with stand against mechanical stresses.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The common materials used for conductors are copper, aluminum, ACSR, iron and steel.</p>
            <h4>Insulator:</h4>
            <p>The function of the insulator on an overhead transmission line is to insulate conductors from support and other parts. The fixing of conductors should be such that current from the conductors do not flow to earth through supports.</p>
            <p>The insulator should have following properties.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>High mechanical strength.</li>
                <li>High dielectric strength.</li>
                <li>High resistance to avoid leakage currents.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The different types of insulators used are,</p>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Pin type insulator</li>
                <li>Suspension type insulator</li>

            <h3>Methods of Reducing Corona Effect:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>By increasing the distance between the two conductors:</b>
                <p>By increasing the distance between the two conductors the critical disruptive voltage and critical visual voltage is raised and hence corona effect can be eliminated.</p></li>
                <li><b>By increasing size of the conductor:</b>
                <p>By increasing the size of the conductor the critical disruptive voltage and critical visual voltage is raised which intern reduces the effect of corona.</p></li>
                <li><b>Shape of conductor:</b>
                <p>The shape of the conductor like hallow cylindrical etc. reduces corona loss compare to any other shape.</p></li>
                <li><b>Effect of load current:</b>
                <p>As the load current increases the temperature of the conductor increases this does not allow snow to deposit on the surface. This reduces the corona loss.</p></li>
                <li><b>Number of conductor per phase:</b>
                <p>For higher voltages a single conductor per phase produces large corona loss hence bundled conductors are used. Due to this self-mean diameter of the conductor increases which increases the disruptive voltage and reduces the corona loss.</p></li>

            <ol type="1">
                <li>1.	Draw in system</li>
                <li>2.	Solid system</li>
                <li>3.	Direct laying system</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>1. Direct Laying System:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">

            </div>
            <p>In direct laying system of cable laying a trench of around 1.5 m deep and 45 cm wide is dug in the ground along the rout of laying. The bottom of trench is covered with a layer of fine sand at about 10 cm thick called sand bed. The cable is directly laid over this sand. The fine sand protects the cable from entry of moisture. Above the cable another layer of fine sand is provided about 10 cm thicknesses to protect the cable against mechanical injury. It is covered with bricks or concrete or tiles. If single trench carries more than one cable then there is chances of mutual heating and fault occurs in one cable can damage the other cable. Hence spacing of 30 cm is provided both vertically and horizontally between two cables. If the soil contains harmful chemical the serving must be adequate to protect the cable from corrosion.</p>
            <h4>Advantages of Direct Laying System:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>It is the simplest and cheapest method.</li>
                <li>It is the safe method and free from the external disturbances like traffic variations etc. </li>
                <li>This method gives best conditions for dissipating heat generated in the cable.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Disadvantages of Direct Laying System:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The alternating work is difficult.</li>

            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/tdu/Drawin_Laying.png" alt="Draw in Laying System" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            </div>
            <p>In this system of laying duct or conduit of cast iron laid along the route of cable. In between these conductors a man holes are made. From the man holes cables are pulled into conduit. During installation according to the requirement the system can be single duct or multi duct. This method of cable laying is used in the cities and areas where digging is difficult. This method is generally used for small distance of laying like road crossing. The length between the man holes should not be too long to make pulling of cable easier.</p>
            <h4>Advantages of Draw in System:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Repairing and maintenance can be easily done without opening the ground.</li>
                <li>Addition and alternation is possible.</li>
                <li>Less chances of fault occurrence.</li>
                <li>Jointing of cables is easy.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Disadvantages of Draw in System:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Initial cost of system is very high.</li>
                <li>The current carrying capacity of cable will be reduced because of close grouping of cables.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3. Solid System:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/tdu/Solid_Laying.png" alt="Solid Laying System" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            </div>
            <p>In this system of cable laying, cable is laid in a through or open pipe placed in earth along the cable route. The through is made up of stone core or concrete or cast iron. After laying cable through is filled with bituminous compound and then covered.</p>
            <p>This method of laying cable is rarely used. Now a day as it is more expensive and it requires skilled labors. The current capacity of the cable in this system is less due to poor heat dissipation facilities.</p>
            <h4>Advantages of Solid System:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Cables laid in this manner are usually having good mechanical protection.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Disadvantages of Solid System:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>It requires skilled labors.</li>
                <li>Current capacity is less due to poor heat dissipation.</li>
                <li>It is more expensive.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Erection of Steel Tower:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/tdu/Elc_Tower.jpg" alt="Erection of Steel Tower" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;">
            </div>
            <p>Erection of towers involves the following.</p>
            <h4>a. Foundation:</h4>
            <p>The foundation of towers is of chimney types. The foundation pits are digged to the depth Mentioned in the foundation plan. For making the foundation of pole or tower a hole should be drilled in the ground. The size of the pit is 1-2 meters X 0.6 meter should be made along the direction of line. The depth of the pit should be in according with the length of the pole or tower. Usually the depth of the pit is 0.17th of the height of the pole which is buried. Pole should be so positioned in the foundation, the bigger section modules of pole is always transverse to the length of the line.</p>
            <h4>b. Stub Setting:</h4>
            <p>The passion of tower which goes in to the foundation is called stub. Stub setting is to be done very correctly in position to keep the tower square in alignment and to give correct slop of the leg member of tower.</p>
            <h4>c. Connecting of Stubs:</h4>
            <p>The stubs after setting will be encased with concrete in the shape according to the drawings. The bottom half is in the shape of truncated pyramid and the top of narrow neck of square section. The mix of concrete is the ratio of 1:5:3.</p>
            <h4>d. Back Filling:</h4>
            <p>The back filling of pits is done with earth stones removed from the pits should be stacked inside the tower based. The tops of concrete left above the ground level should be kept wet for 14 days.</p>
            <h4>e. Fabricating of Tower:</h4>
            <p>When concreting becomes strong and solid the angles of designed sizes are attached to each other starting from studs. The section angles strips are jointed with required size of nuts and bolts as per the supplied drawings under the supervision.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The above figure shows the 3 core XLPE cable. XLPE stands for Cross Linked Polyethylene Insulation is widely used as electrical insulation in power cables of all voltage ranges but it is especially well suited for medium voltage applications. In this cable each core is insulated by layers of XLPE. Then XLPE is covered by a metallic screen. The metallic screen is generally a copper or aluminum. Around the 3 cores additional conducting belt of copper is wrapped, metallic sheath, bedding, armoring and serving is done in usual manner. In this 3 metallic screen, conducting belt and lead sheath are in electrical contact and are connected to earth.</p>

            <h3>Faults in UG cables:</h3>
            <p>Various types of faults occurring in UG cables are,</p>
            <h4>1. Open Circuit Faults:</h4>
            <p>OC faults are a kind of fault that occurs as a result of the conductor breaking or the conductor being pulled out of its joints. In such instants there will be no flow of current at all as the conductor is broken.</p>
            <h4>2. Short Circuit Faults:</h4>
            <p>It occurs only in multicore cables when two or more conductors of the same cable come in contact with each other known as a SC faults. It is impossible to detect visually without taking the cable apart. A SC faults occurs when the individual insulation of the cable is damaged. It can also be detected using megger.</p>
            <h4>3. Earth Faults:</h4>
            <p>This kind of faults occurs when the insulation of the cables gets damaged. Then the conductors of the cables comes contact with the earth. It is called an earth faults. The current flowing through the faulty cable starts flowing from the core of the cable to earth. Current will not flow to the load.</p>
