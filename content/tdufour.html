        <h2>CHAPTER 04 : ELECTRIC HEATING AND WELDING</h2>
            <h3>Electrical Heating:</h3>
            <p>Electrical heating is a process in which electrical energy is converted into heat energy. It works on the principle of joule’s law.</p>
            <h3>Joule’s Law:</h3>
            <p>The amount of heat production in a conductor is directly proportional to the square of electrical current flowing through the conductor, Resistance of the conductor and the time for which electric current flows through the conductor.</p>
            <div style="overflow-x: auto">
                \[H = {I^2}Rt\;\;\;\;\;Joules\]
            </div>
            <h3>Applications of electrical heating:</h3>
            <p>Now a days electrical heating is most used for domestic appliances as well as in industrial process control applications such as,</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Electric iron</li>
                <li>Electric oven</li>

                <li>Hotplates for cooking</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Advantages of electrical heating:</h3>
            <p><b>Cleanliness:</b> Electric energy is the cleanest form of energy it will not produce ash or dust during heating.</p>
            <p><b>No pollution:</b> Absence of flue, gases doesn’t results in pollution of atmosphere.</p>
            <p><b>Ease of control:</b> Simple, reliable and accurate control of temperature can be obtained.</p>
            <p><b>Higher efficiency:</b> The efficiency of utilization of electrical heating is much higher as compare to other system of heating.</p>
            <p><b>Safety:</b> Automatic protection against over current as overheating can be provided through proper switchgear.</p>
            <p><b>Economical:</b> Electrical energy is cheaper and it is produced in a large scale. The initial cost, running cost and maintenance cost of electrical energy are low.</p>
            <p><b>Uniform heating:</b> The heating can be generated with the work piece resulting in the uniform heating.</p>
            <p><b>High temperature:</b> The material can be heated to any temperature without any limit.</p>

            <p><b>Low attention and maintenance cost:</b> The attention required by electric heating equipment is negligible their by the maintenance cost is low.</p>
            <h3>Modes or methods of heat transfer:</h3>
            <p>There are three modes of heat transfer from a body at high temperature to a bod at low temperature. They are,</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Conduction</li>
                <li>Convection</li>
                <li>Radiation</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>1) Conduction:</h4>
            <p>In this mode of heat transfer the heat is transferred from one part of the substance to the other from molecular to molecular due to the temperature gradient between the two parts without the actual movement of the molecules.</p>
            <p>Heat transferred in solids by conduction.</p>
            <h4>2) Convection:</h4>
            <p>In this method heat is transferred from one part of the substance to the other by actual movement of the heated molecules. Heat in water and air is transferred by convection.</p>
            <h4>3) Radiation:</h4>
            <p>In this mode of heat transfer, the heat is transferred from one body to the other without actually heating the medium in between. The sun rays reaches the earth without heating the atmosphere or a man sitting by the side of fire receives heat without the air in between getting heated up.</p>
            <h3>Classification (or) methods of electrical heating:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Power frequency heating

                            <ol type="a">

                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>High frequency heating
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>Induction heating
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li>Direct core type induction heating</li>
                                <li>Coreless type induction heating</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Dielectric heating</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Direct resistance heating:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/tdu/Direct_Resistance_Heating.png" alt="Direct resistance heating" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            </div>
            <p>The above figure shows the diagram of direct resistance heating method. The material or charge to be heated is in the form of powder or small pieces or a liquid solution. The current is directly passed through the charge through electrodes. The charge itself forms the resistance and heat is directly produced in the charge. Where the supply is DC or AC single phase, two electrodes are used. If supply is three phase AC then three electrodes are used.</p>
            <p>The electrodes are partially inversed on the charge and supply is given. When the charge is in the form of pieces, a powder of high resistivity material is sprinted over the surface of charge to prevent any possible short circuit between the pieces. This method of heating has high efficiency as heat is directly produced in the charge and in this method uniform and high temperature can be obtained.</p>
            <h3>Indirect resistance heating:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/tdu/Indirect_Resistance_Heating.png" alt="Indirect resistance heating" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            </div>
            <p>The above figure shows the diagram of indirect resistance heating. In this method the current is passed through resistive element which is either placed above or bellows the oven depending upon the nature of the job to be performed. The heat proportional to I2R losses produced in heating element deliver to the charge either by radiation or by convection. Both AC and DC supply can be used. Commonly ised resistance oven is a best example of this type automatic temperature control can be provided in this case.</p>
            <h3>Properties for making heating element:</h3>
            <h4>1) High resistivity:</h4>
            <p>The resistivity if material used for making heating element should be high. This will reduces the length if the heating element.</p>
            <h4>2) Free from oxidization:</h4>
            <p>The element material should not be oxidized when subjected to high temperature.</p>
            <h4>3) High melting point:</h4>
            <p>Its melting point should be higher than its operating temperature. Otherwise a small rise in the voltage will damage the element.</p>
            <h4>4) Anticorrosive:</h4>
            <p>In many heating process the heating atmosphere is corrosive. When exposed to this atmosphere or any other chemical fumes the filament should not corrode. Otherwise its resistance will change and life will be shortened.</p>
            <h4>5) Mechanical Strength:</h4>
            <p>The material used should have sufficient mechanical strength of its own.</p>
            <h4>6) Withstand vibrations:</h4>
            <p>In most industrial processes quite strong vibrations are produced so the element material should withstand the vibrations while hot and should not breakdown.</p>
            <h4>7) Ductile:</h4>
            <p>To have convenient shapes and sizes the material used should have ductility and flexibility.</p>
            <h4>8) Low temperature coefficient of resistance:</h4>
            <p>For accurate temperature control the resistance should be nearly constant at all temperatures. This can be obtained only if the resistance of the material does not change appreciably.</p>
            <h3>Causes of failure of heating elements:</h3>
            <p>Some of the factors responsible for failure of heating elements are,</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Formation of hotspots</li>
                <li>Oxidization</li>
                <li>Corrosion</li>
                <li>Mechanical failure</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Corrosion:</h4>
            <p>For industrial operations, if the filaments are directly exposed to chemical fumes the reactions will corrode the contact region; from this the passion of the element will ultimately fail.</p>
            <h4>Oxidization:</h4>
            <p>The outer or exposed surface the element gets oxidized at higher temperatures. During switching operations the oxide layer gets flacked off exposing inner surface to atmosphere. During further operation the exposed inner surface oxidized and resulting into formation of hotspots and ultimately breakdown.</p>
            <h4>Formation of hotspots:</h4>
            <p>Due to high rate of local osculation the resistance of the area increases such spots are called as hotspots. Due to generation of more heat at hotspots the heating element may get damaged. This indicated comparatively higher operating temperature at the particular spots as compare to the rest of the filament.</p>
            <p>Causes of formation of hotspots are,</p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>Excessive oxidization</li>
                <li>Shielded by supporting structure</li>
                <li>Unequal spacing</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Methods of controlling the temperature of resistance oven:</h3>
            <p>The temperature in a resistance furnace can be controlled using following methods.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>ON/OFF control (intermittent switching)</li>
                <li>Varying the no. of elements</li>
                <li>Variation in circuit configuration</li>
                <li>Change of applied voltage
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Tapping the input</li>
                        <li>Bucking boosting the secondary voltage</li>
                        <li>Auto transformer control</li>
                        <li>Series reactor control</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>1. ON/OFF control (Intermittent Switching):</h4>
            <p>In this method the furnace voltage is switched ON/OFF intermittently. When the supply is switched OFF, heat produced is decreases and the temperature is reduced. When the supply is switched ON heat produced is increases and hence the temperature also increases. This type is suitable for small furnace only. Since entire furnace is switched OFF and ONN in this process, there is a lot of arching at the switching contacts.</p>
            <h4>2) Varying the no. of elements:</h4>
            <p>In this case with the help of a switch the no. of heating elements across the supply are changed, less no. of heating elements used, less will be the heat produced and hence the temperature will be less. In this case of three phase circuit equal no. of heating elements will be simultaneously switched of in each phase to maintain balanced condition. The most important drawback of varying the no. of elements is that it does not provide a uniform heating.</p>
            <h4>3) Variation in circuit configuration:</h4>
            <p>In this method the elements are connected in all possible series and parallel combinations and in star or delta by means of switches to obtain different temperatures. This is simplest and most commonly used method of temperature control. The different methods of connections are shown in figure.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center">

            <p><cite>Fig (d)</cite></p>
            </div>
            <p>Suppose when no. of resistive elements are connected in parallel voltage across each resistance is same that is V volts. In the series parallel arrangement the voltage across each element is reduced to V/2 volts. Therefore power dissipated in series parallel arrangement is ½ of the parallel arrangement.</p>
            <p>In case of three phase circuit the heating elements will give different heat when in star formation and more heat when in delta formation.</p>
            <h4>4) Change of applied voltage (tapping the input):</h4>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/tdu/Change_of_Applied_Voltage.png" alt="Change of applied voltage" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            </div>
            <p>In this method transformer having high voltage on primary side and tapping control also high voltage side is advisable.</p>
            <p>The amount of heat produced in a furnace is <span>\({I^2}Rt\)</span> or <span>\(\frac{{{E^2}t}}{R}\)</span>. Hence by varying the applied voltage the temperature can be controlled.</p>
            <p>In this case a step down transformer is used. The voltage is varied by providing tapping on the primary side as shown in figure has the current is less on this side.</p>
            <h4>5) Bucking and boosting the secondary voltage:</h4>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/tdu/Bucking_Boosting_Secondary_Voltage_1.png" alt="Bucking and boosting the secondary voltage" style="width: 100%; max-width: 300px;">
            <p><cite>Fig (a): Boosting connection.</cite></p>
            </div>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/tdu/Bucking_Boosting_Secondary_Voltage_2.png" alt="Bucking and boosting the secondary voltage" style="width: 100%; max-width: 300px;">
            <p><cite>Fig (b): Bucking connection.</cite></p>
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>•	In this method secondary winding is divided into two sections. One with lesser number of turns and other with larger number of turns.</li>
                <li>•	Depending on the direction of smallest section and current in the secondary winding, the induced EMF can be increased (boosting) or decreased (bucking).</li>
                <li>	If the secondary winding is connected in series and the direction of current in the smaller section is same. Its induced EMF adds to the EMF in the larger section of the secondary. This action is called as boosting. That is E<sub>2</sub>+E<sub>3</sub>.</li>
                <li>	When the connection of this secondary winding is reversed, the induced EMF in the smaller section is opposite to the larger section EMF. This action is called as bucking. That is E<sub>2</sub>-E<sub>3</sub>.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>6) Series reactor control:</h4>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/tdu/Series_Reactor_Control.png" alt="Series reactor control" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            </div>
            <p>In this method a heavy coil wound on a core is placed in series with the furnace. A part of applied voltage draws across the reactor and rest appears across the furnace, thereby reducing the temperature inside the furnace.</p>
            <p>The introduction of reactance in series with the furnace can reduces the PF. A capacitor is introduced in the circuit for keeping the PF near unity.</p>
            <h4>7) Auto transformer control:</h4>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/tdu/Autotransformer_Control.png" alt="Auto transformer control" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            </div>
            <p>In this method an auto transformer with tapping is used as shown in the figure. It is used to obtain different voltages across the furnace and hence temperature can be controlled.</p>
            <h3>Arc Furnace (Arc Heating):</h3>
            <p>The arc furnace is used for melting or extracting of metals need a high temperature operation.</p>
            <p>If an air gap between two electrode is subjected to a very high voltage, the air in between gets ionized and the ionized air becomes conducting. Hence the current starts flowing between the two electrodes through the air in the form of continuous spark (arc). This electric discharge between two electrodes through air is known as an electric arc. The temperature obtained from the arc is between 3000<sup>0</sup> C and 3500<sup>0</sup> C.</p>
            <h3>Direct Arc Heating:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/tdu/Direct_Arc_Heating.png" alt="Direct arc Heating" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            </div>
            <p>In this type the charge act as another electrode, so that the arc current flows through the charge and there is a direct contact between the arc and the charge. Electrically these furnaces are further sub divided into 2 categories.</p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>Conducting bottom</li>
                <li>Non-conducting bottom</li>

            <p>The heating process is faster in direct arc furnace hence heating efficiency is too high.</p>
            <p>Direct arc furnace is usually adapted for steel production due to its high capital cost it is usually not employed for melting process.</p>
            <h3>Indirect Arc Heating:</h3>

            <img src="img/tdu/Indirect_Arc_Heating.png" alt="Indirect arc furnace" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            </div>
            <p>In this method arc is produced between two electrodes and heat is transmitted to the charge by radiation. That is the arc does not come in contact with the charge but heat is transferred through radiation from arc to top layer of charge and through conduction from top layer to the bottom layer in the charge. The construction of such type of furnace limits the use of two electrodes, there by only single phase is used. The current does not flow through the charge, hence there is no automatic stirring and furnace is require to be rocked mechanically.</p>
            <h3>Induction heating:</h3>
            <p>An induction furnace is an electrical furnace in which heat is applied by induction heating of metal. Induction heating is based on the principle of AC transformer. There is a primary winding through which an AC current is passed this coil is magnetically coupled with the metal to be heated. An electric current is induced in this metal is dependent on,</p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>The magnitude of the primary current.</li>
                <li>The ratio of no. of turns in the primary and secondary circuit.</li>
                <li>The coefficient of magnetic coupling.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This induced current has the heating effect similar to any other electric current through an ordinary resistance.</p>
            <h3>Direct core type induction furnace:</h3>

            </div>
            <p>In this type the charge forms the short circuited secondary of the transformer. Therefore it is like a transformer. The secondary is magnetically coupled to the primary winding. The charge is melted due to heavy current induced in it. When there is no molten metal no current will be flowing in the secondary. Thus to start the furnace molten is poured in the annular hearth or a sufficient quantity is left over from the previous melted charge.</p>
            <h3>Indirect core type induction furnace:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/tdu/Indirect_Core_Type_Induction_Heating.png" alt="Indirect core type induction furnace" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;">
            </div>
            <p>In this type of furnace the principle of induction has been utilized for providing heat treatment to metal. Figure represents the indirect induction heating. The secondary winding forms the walls of metal container and the iron core links the primary as well as secondary winding. Heat produced due to induced current is transmitted to the charge by radiation. The part LM of the magnetic circuit is made up a special alloy and it’s kept inside the chamber of furnace. When the temperature reaches its critical value the reluctance increases appreciably there by decreasing the inductive effect thus the temperature of the furnace can be very effectively control which is a great advantage.</p>

                \[EddyCurrent = \alpha {\beta ^2}{f^2}\]
            </div>
            <p>Where β flux density and f is is the frequency</p>
            <p>In a coreless furnace there is no core and thus the flux density will be low. Hence for compensating the low flux density the primary current applied to the primary coil should have sufficient high frequency. Thus by applying current of high frequency the core of the induction furnace can be eliminated their by reducing its weight and increasing the flexibility. The above figure shows the general construction of high frequency coreless induction furnace. The eddy currents are sufficient to heat the metal to melting point and also setup electromagnetic forces.</p>
            <p>Due to high frequency there will be skin effect and it causes the resistance of the conductor to increase slightly in the primary coil and it will cause high copper losses. Due to high amount of copper losses the temperature of primary winding increases considerably. To cool down the coil artificial method is employed.</p>

            </div>
            <p>In this type of butt welding the material parts to be welded or joined end to end as shown in figure. The heating in this particular case is obtained by the contact resistance of the metals to be welded. A pressure is applied either manually or with toggle mechanism. A heavy current is passed from the welding transformer which creates the necessary heat at the joined due to the high resistance of the contact area. The metal at the join melts the parts fuse together providing a bulged joint.</p>

            <p>This is similar to butt welding except in this method the voltage to the metal part is applied before these are butted together. The two metal pieces to be welded are clamped strongly in a flash welding machine. The metal parts when come near to each other there them appearance on arc which burns the contact surface.

            <p>The metal sheets are placed in between two water cooled electrodes, which must possess high electrical and thermal conductivity. The water cooled electrode is pumped water to cool the metal sheets after the weld is completed. The electrical current used in spot welding moves through the electrode at a rate of mili seconds and produces limited amount of heat therefore making it less dangerous and required less energy to perform.</p>

            <p>It is similar to spot welding except that series of spots are produced by roller electrodes instead of tip electrodes. The electrodes will localize the current and pressure to thee welding point. The wheels in this case are forming two electrodes, either the wheels are moved on the metal sheets or the plates are moved under wheels. An interrupt is provider on the circuit which turns ON the supply for a period sufficient to hot the welding point. After the point welded the current is interrupted by an interrupter. Water solution is used to cool the metals after the weld is completed.</p>

            <p>It is the modification form of spot welding. On this method the current and pressure are localized to the welding points. When there are two plates of different cross sectional areas, then it is necessary for obtaining desirable strength to have the projection on the ticker place. In case the welding is required on plates of different materials then the projection should be made on the high conductivity materials.</p>
            <p>The above figure represents the cross sections for projection welding to be used for flat or irregular stamping.</p>
            <h3>Electric arc welding:</h3>
            <p>In this method an arc is obtained between the electrode and the metal connected to a suitable source. Required amount of current can obtained either AC or DC source. One terminal is connected to the electrode and other to the work piece and the circuit is completed through an air gap is provided between the tip of the electrode and the surface of the work piece by leaping the electrode at a distance of about 3 mm to 6 mm from the surface of work piece. Due to interruption by the air gap is produced and the temperature attained 3500<sup>0</sup>C and the electrical energy is converted into the arc and into heat energy.</p>

            <p>For obtaining arc the required amount of voltage on AC supply system is between 70 to 100 V and on DC supply system is between 50 V to 60 V. once the arc is struck, 20-30 V is only required to maintain heat.</p>

            </div>
            <p>In this case AC machine (transformer) having drooping characteristics is used. The drooping characteristic is obtained in AC equipment by means of reactance coil in series with the arc. The normal supply voltage is stepped down to the striking voltage. The voltage at the secondary side of the transformer remains constant almost and it available for striking the arc, but as soon as the current flow the voltage drop across the reactance coil reduces the voltage at the arc to the required value. The reactance coil also controls the flow of current. This is archived by either having tapped coils or by the lamination iron core of the reactance coil.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Laser beam welding is a modern welding process. The focal spot is targeted on the work piece surface which will be welded. At the surface the large concentration of light energy is converted into thermal energy. The surface of the work piece starts melting and progresses through it by surface conductance. The penetration of the work piece depends on conducted heat and the thickness of the material to be welded. The losing source is based on the principle of excitation of atoms using intense light, electron beams, chemicals and the spontaneous release of photons.
