        <h2>CHAPTER 03 : OPTOELECTRONIC DEVICES</h2>
            <p>Every atom contains three particles, electron, proton and neutron. In the lattice structure, neutron and protons from the nucleus and electron appear in the fixed orbits around the nucleus.</p>
            <p>In the conductor the electrons are loosely bound to the nucleus when compare to the bad conductors. The unbound electrons which are in the outermost orbit move randomly with in the conductor and are called free electrons.</p>
            <p><b>Random motion:</b></p>
            <div style="text-align: center">

            <h3>Electron Emission:</h3>
            <p>The liberating of electrons from the surface of a substance generally metals that is conductor is called electron emission.</p>
            <p>These electrons move at large speed but they cannot move or leave out of the metal surface. It is because of the free electrons when try to leave the metal surface, they find behind them the positive nuclei which leads them back on the surface.</p>
            <h3>Surface Barrier:</h3>
            <p>The force by which metal surface prevents the free electrons from escaping is called surface barrier of that metal.</p>
            <p>However if a sufficient external energy is given to the metal that increases the energy of the electron due to this they cross over the barrier and escape the metal surface.</p>
            <p>The amount of energy required by an electron to overcome the surface barrier of a metal to escape from the surface is called work function of the metal.</p>
            <p>There are different types of electron emission based on external energy supplied to the metal which is equal to the work function of the metal.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Thermionic emission</li>
                <li>Secondary emission</li>
                <li>Field emission</li>
                <li>Photon emission / photo electric</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In order to cause the electron emission from the surface of the metal it is possible by sufficient external energy is supplied from the source.</p>
            <p>Based on the type of additional energy used for the causing of electron emission there are classified as,</p>
            <h4>Thermionic Emission:</h4>
            <p>In this method the metal is heated with sufficient temperature.</p>
            <p>The free electrons will get sufficient energy causing electron to enable them to escape from the metal surface. It is known as thermionic emission.</p>
            <h4>Field Emission:</h4>
            <p>In this method electron can be pulled out of the metal surface by the application of strong electrostatic field on the surface of a metal. This is known as field emission.</p>
            <h4>Secondary Emission:</h4>
            <p>In this method a very high velocity electron being strikes the metal surface causing the electron present on the conductor surface to move out. This is known as secondary emission.</p>
            <h4>Photo Electric Emission:</h4>
            <p>In this method surface of the certain metals are illuminated by a beam of light. Electrons are rejected out of the metal surface by the photons incident on the surface. Such electron emission is known as photo electric emission.</p>
            <p>photons are pockets of energy travelling light</p>
            <h3>Photo Diode:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A photo diode is two terminal PN junction reverse biased in which reverse current increases when junction is exposed to light.</li>
                <li>Photo diode is sensitive to light in this diode glass window gets light pass through the package of the junction.</li>
                <li>The incoming light strikes or bombards PN junction and dislodges / release valance electrons and holes.</li>
                <li>Stronger light greater the number of minority carriers and larger is the reverse current.</li>
            </ul>

            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>The reverse current in the photo diode is directly proportional to the intensity of light falling on the PN junction.</li>
                <li>This means greater the intensity of light falling on the PN junction of the photo diode greater will be the reverse current.</li>
                <li>When no light is incident on the PN junction of photo diode the reverse current IR is very small called Dark Current.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Applications of photo diode:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Photo diode can turn its current ON and OFF in nano seconds hence it is one of the fastest photo detectors.</li>

                <li>Photon after entering through P type material. Itâ€™s an atom in the depletion layer causes electrons to break out of the covalent bonds. This causes electron hole pair.</li>

            <p>An opto coupler combines an LED and a photo diode. An opto coupler is a device which used light to couple a signal from input to its output. The LED is on input side and photo diode in output side this arrangement is called opto coupler.</p>
            <p>In opto coupler circuit, the left source voltage and a series resistor set a current through LED. The light from LED strikes photo diode and up a reverse current in the output circuit this reverse current produces output voltage across resistor.</p>
            <p>The output voltage depends on the reverse current if LED supply changed and this causes photo diode current to change and as results as output voltage change.</p>
