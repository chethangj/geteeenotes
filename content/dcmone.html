        <h2>CHAPTER 01 : DC Generators Construction and Working</h2>
            <h3>DC generators:</h3>
            <p>DC generator is a machine that converters mechanical energy into electrical energy.</p>
            <h3>Working principle:</h3>
            <p>DC generator works on the principle of faradays law of electromagnetic induction that is whenever a conductor cuts the magnetic lines of flux an emf is induced in that conductor.</p>
            <p>Therefore a DC generator works on the principle of production of dynamically induced emf, the direction of induced emf is determined by Fleming’s right hand rule (generator rule).</p>
            <h3>Fleming’s right hand rule:</h3>
            <p>This rule is used to find out the direction of induced emf in the conductor. This rule states that,</p>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/dcm/fleming_right_hand_rule.png" alt="Fleming’s right hand rule" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            </div>
            <p>If we extended first three fingers of right hand such that they are mutually parallel to each other. Then the fore figure represents the direction of flux, the thumb figure indicates the direction of motion of the conductor and the middle figure indicates the direction of induced emf.</p>
            <h3>Simple loop generator:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/dcm/simple_loop_generator.png" alt="Simple loop generator" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;">
            </div>
            <p>Consider a single turn rectangular copper coil ABCD rotating in clockwise direction in the uniform magnetic field at constant speed. Two springs S1 and S2, brushes B1 and B2 are used to connect emf induced in the coil when it’s rotate. The load resistance RL is connected between the brushes B1 and B2. A prime mover is used to rotate the coil at constant speed in the direction indicated in figure (a). The coil is shown to rotate in the clockwise direction. In figure (b) the emf induced in the coil at different position is plotted.</p>
            <p>The coil rotates flux linking the coil sides AB and CD changes continuously therefore emf induced in the coil side also changes as the coil rotates. When the coil s moving about position number one the instantaneous movement of the coil is parallel to the flux therefore numbers of emf induced in the coil at position one is zero. e1=0 volts.</p>
            \[{e_1} = BlV\;Sin\theta \]
            \[\theta  = 0\]
            \[{e_1} = BlV\;Sin\left( 0 \right)\]
            \[{e_1} = 0\]
            <p>When the coil is in the position 2 coil sides are moving at angle of 450 to the flux therefore the some emf is induced in the coil at position 2.</p>
            \[{e_2} = BlV\;Sin\theta \]
            \[{e_3} = BlV\;\sin {45^0}\]
            \[{e_2} = BlV\;0.707\]
            \[{e_2} = {E_m}\;0.707\;volts\]
            <p>When the coil is in the position 3, coil sides are moving at right angle to the flux the rate of change of flux linkage is maximum at position 3 (θ=900). Therefore maximum emf is induced in the coil at position 3.</p>
            \[{e_3} = BlV\;Sin\theta \]
            \[{e_3} = BlV\;\sin {90^0}\]
            \[{e_3} = {E_{max}} \times 1\]
            \[{e_3} = {E_{max}}\]
            <p>At position 4, emf induced in the coil is same as that of in the coil at position 2 but the emf induced is decrease.</p>
            \[{e_4} = BlV\;Sin\theta \]
            \[{e_4} = BlV\;\sin {145^0}\]
            \[{e_4} = {E_{max\;}}\;0.707\;volts\]
            <p>At position 5, the instantaneous movement of the coil is parallel to lines of flux therefore numbers of emf is induced in the coil at position 5.</p>
            \[{e_5} = BlV\;Sin\theta \]
            \[{e_5} = BlV\;\sin {180^0}\]
            \[{e_5} = 0\;volts\]
            <p>After the position 5 direction of rotation of coil changes therefore the direction of emf induced is changes. The variation of induced emf in the coil from position to position 5 is same as that in the position 1.</p>
            \[{e_6} = BlV\;Sin\theta \]
            \[{e_6} = BlV\;\sin {225^0}\]
            \[{e_6} = BlV - 0.707\]
            \[{e_6} = {E_{m\;}} - 0.707\;volts\]
            <br>
            \[{e_7} = BlV\;Sin\theta \]
            \[{e_7} = BlV\;\sin {270^0}\]
            \[{e_7} = {E_{m\;}} - 1\;volts\]
            <br>
            \[{e_8} = BlV\;Sin\theta \]
            \[{e_8} = BlV\;\sin {315^0}\]
            \[{e_8} = {E_{m\;}} - 0.707\;volts\]
            <br>
            \[{e_9} = BlV\;Sin\theta \]
            \[{e_9} = BlV\;\sin {360^0}\]
            \[{e_9} = 0\;volts\]
            <p>In figure (b) the variation of emf in the coil is plotted against position. It is same that the waveform of emf induced having positive and negative half cycle, the emf induced in AC that is in the armature of the DC generator the emf induced is AC. In order obtain unidirectional current DC the splits are replaced by split rings or commutator. Direction of current through RL by split rings.</p>

            </div>
            <p>It is seen from the figure (a) that the direction of current through RL is ABMLCD from 0 to 1800 in the next half revolution that is from 1800 to 3600 in figure (b) the direction of current RL is DCLMBA. We have seen that the direction of current in the RL serves after every 1800 is changes. This current is called alternating current.</p>
            <h3>Use of split rings or commutators to obtain unidirectional current:</h3>

            </div>
            <p>For obtaining the unidirectional current in the external circuit from split rings are replaced by split rings as shown in the diagram.</p>
            <p>Figure (a) that the direction of current is ABMLCD that is current will flow from ML through load resistor RL in the first half revolution in the next half revolution that is from 1800 to 3600 in figure (b).</p>
            <p>The position of the coil sides get interchange at the same time position of split rings also gets interchange as shown in figure (b). It is seen that brush number B1 is known making contact with split ring S2 and B2 is making contact with S1.</p>
            <p>The direction of current through load resistance RL is DCMNBSS that is the current will again flow from M to L through resistive load RL in second half revolution also. In this way split ring helps us to obtain unidirectional current in the external circuit. Split rings are also called as commutator.</p>

            <p>It is the outer most cover of DC machine. The insulating material get protected from harmful atmospheric elements like moisture, dust etc. it provides the mechanical support to the poles. It provides the path of low reactance for magnetic flux.</p>
            <p>Choice of material:</p>
            <p>It is made up of cast iron because it is cheapest for log machines. Rolled steel cast iron silicon steel is used which provides high permeability and gives good mechanical strength.</p>
            <h4>Eye bolt:</h4>
            <p>It is necessary to lift the machine.</p>
            <h4>Poles:</h4>
            <p>The poles are divided into two parts. That is,</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Pole core</li>
                <li>Pole shoes</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The <b>pole cores</b> are carries a field winding which is necessary to produce flux and it is direct the flux produce through air gap to armature core to the next poles.</p>
            <p>A <b>Pole shoe</b> enlarges the area of armature to come across the flux and it produces large induced emf. It gives particular shape.</p>
            <p>Choice of material:</p>
            <p>It is made up of magnetic material like cast iron and cast steel. It has to carry flux, providing a path of low reluctance.</p>
            <h4>Field winding:</h4>
            <p>Field winding is used to carry current due to pole core. It works on the principle of electromagnetic induction to produce the flux in a magnetic field that is exiting the poles as an electromagnet. It is called field winding or exiting winding.</p>
            <p>Choice of material:</p>
            <p>It carries the current so it is made up of conducting material like aluminium, copper. The field windings are south pole as well as north pole.</p>
            <h4>Armature:</h4>
            <p>The armature is divided into two parts.</p>

                <li>Armature winding</li>
            </ol>
            <p><b>a. Armature core:</b></p>
            <p>Armature core is a cylindrical shape mounted to the shaft and air ducks to prevent the air flow through armature for the purpose of cooling.</p>
            <p>The armature core provides house for armature winding that is armature conductors. It provides low reluctance of magnetic flux produce by the filed winding.</p>
            <p>Choice of material:</p>
            <p>The armature winding is nothing but the inter connection of the armature conductors placed in the slots provided on the armature core.</p>
            <p><b>b. Armature winding</b></p>
            <p>When the armature is rotated in case of generator magnetic flux get cuts by armature conductors and emf get induced in the armature winding. Generation of emf in the generator takes place in the armature winding when current supplying in case of DC motor to do the useful work in the external circuit.</p>
            <p>Choice of material:</p>
            <p>It is made up of copper. The conductors are placed in the armature slots which are lined with insulating material.</p>
            <h4>Commutator:</h4>
            <p>In the commutator it converters AC to DC. It is a cylindrical in shape and consists of a number of copper segments; each segment is insulated from each other by mica insulation. The emf induced in the armature conductors is alternating. It produces the unidirectional torque.</p>
            <p>Choice of material:</p>
            <p>The material used is high conductivity copper. It is made up of shaped segment magnet.</p>
            <h4>Brushes and brush gears:</h4>
            <p>Brushes are used for collecting the output current from the commutator and make it available to the stationary external circuit. The brushes are made up of soft material carbon. It is in rectangular shape.</p>
            <p>The brushes are made to press on the commutator surface by means of a spring the tension can be adjusted with the help of liver. It is also avoid the wear tear commutator.</p>
            <h4>Bearings:</h4>
            <p>Bearings are used to obtain free and smooth rotation. It is fitted inside the end covers and between them armature rotates. For smaller machines ball bearings and for large machines roller bearings are used.</p>

            <h3>Types of armature winding:</h3>
            <p>There are numbers armature conductors which are connected in specific manner as per the requirement is called armature winding.</p>
            <p>Basically the armature winding is divided into two types.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Lap winding</li>
                <li>Wave winding</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>1. Lap winding:</h3>
            <p>In the lap winding the conductor connection is in slot one then the connections are overlap each other as shown in the figure.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/dcm/lap_winding.png" alt="Lap winding" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            </div>
            <p>The over lapping of the winding is as shown in the figure. The total numbers of conductor are getting divided into poles (P) that is no. of parallel path. Where P= no. of poles in the machine.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>2. Wave winding:</h3>
            <p>This type of winding avoids the overlap. It is a progressive wave that is called as wave winding. Both coils starting from a lot one and slot two are in progressive waveform.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/dcm/wave_winding.png" alt="Wave winding" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            </div>
            <p>The total no. of conductors gets into two parallel path always irrespective no. of poles (P) of the machine. The no. of parallel path in which armature conductors are divided due to lap or wave winding of connection that is denoted as A.</p>
            <p>A=P for lap winding.<br>A=2 for wave winding.</p>
            <h3>Winding technology:</h3>
            <h4>1) Conductor:</h4>
            <p>Conductor is a length of wire which is laying in a magnetic field where the emf is induced.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/dcm/conductor.png" alt="Conductor" style="width: 100%; max-width: 300px;">
            </div>
            <h4>2) Turns:</h4>
            <p>Two conductors are placed in different slots when connected together forms a turns.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/dcm/turns.png" alt="Turns" style="width: 100%; max-width: 300px;">
            </div>

            <p>For lap winding,</p>
            \[{Y_R} = {Y_B} - {Y_F}\]

            <h3>Single layer winding:</h3>

                <li>Entire winding must forms a closed path.</li>
                <li>The average pitch of the lap winding is \(\frac{Z}{P}\) while that for the wave winding is \(\frac{{Z \pm 2}}{P}\).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Applications for windings:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The lap winding has the number of path A=P this winding is used for applications which require more current and less voltage. It is possible to obtain higher value of current and less emf will br produce. It requires equalizing connection.</li>
                <li>This winding is used for the application which requires higher voltage and lesser current since number of parallel path are equal to 2 that is A=2. It gives more emf and equalizing connections are not necessary.</li>

            <h3>Types of DC generator:</h3>
            <p>Depending on the way in which the field winding is excited in the DC generator.</p>
            <p>The classification of DC generator is,</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Separately excited DC generator</li>
                <li>Self-excited DC generator</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Separately excited DC generator:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/dcm/separatley_excited_DC_generator.png" alt="Separately excited DC generator" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            </div>
            <p>In separately excited generator the field winding is excited from a separate source of DC current.</p>
            <p>The field winding is excited separately so field current depends on supply voltage and resistance of the field winding.</p>
            <p>In the armature side we can see that the supplying a load, demanding a load current of IL at voltage Vt is called terminal voltage.</p>
            \[i.e.,\;{I_a} = {I_L}\]
            <p>The power developed in the armature side</p>
            \[{P_A} = {E_g}{I_A}\]
            <p>Power developed at the load (output)</p>
            \[{P_L} = V{I_A}\]
            <p>The emf induced E has three component namely,</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Terminal voltage (V<sub>t</sub>)</li>
                <li>Armature resistance drop (IaRa)</li>
                <li>Brush contact drop (V<sub>brush</sub>)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>So voltage equation for separately excited generator is,</p>
            \[E = {V_t} + {I_a}{R_a} + {V_{brush}}\]
            <h3>Self-excited DC generator:</h3>
            <p>In this self-excited generator the field winding is excited by the emf developed by the armature itself depending on the way in which field winding is connected to the armature.</p>
            <p>The self-excited generators are classified into three types.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Shunt generator</li>
                <li>Series generator</li>
                <li>Compound generator</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Shunt DC generator:</h3>
            <p>In this type of generator field winding is connected in parallel to the armature winding. More number of turns is connected in shunt field so that the smaller cross section. The resistance of shunt field is more.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/dcm/shunt_DC_generator.png" alt="Shunt DC generator" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            </div>
            <p>Voltage and current relation in the shunt DC generator that is Ia=I<sub>L</sub>+I<sub>sh</sub>.</p>
            <p>The voltage across the load is V<sub>t</sub> is same across field winding. Both are parallel with each other.</p>
            \[{I_{sh}} = \frac{{{V_t}}}{{{R_{sh}}}}\]
            <p>When emf induced E still requires supplying voltage drop IaRa and brushing contact drop.</p>
            <p>Therefore,</p>
            \[E = {V_t} + {I_a}{R_a} + {V_{brush}}\]
            <p>Where,</p>
            \[E = \frac{{N\emptyset ZP}}{{60A}}\]
            <h3>Series DC generator:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/dcm/series_DC_generator.png" alt="Series DC generator" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            </div>
            <p>In the series DC generator the field winding is connected in series with armature winding. Series winding consists of few turns so that the larger cross section. The resistance of the series field id very less. Series field winding carries small current of armature.</p>
            <p>Voltage and current relationship is,</p>
            <p>Field, armature and load are in series hence they carry the same current.</p>
            <p>Therefore,</p>
            \[{I_A} = {I_{se}} = {I_L}\]
            <p>Voltage equation is,</p>
            \[E = {V_t} + {I_A}{R_A} + {I_{se}}{R_{se}} + {V_{brush}}\]
            \[E = {V_t} + {I_A}\left( {{R_A} + {R_{se}}} \right) + {V_{brush}}\]
            <h3>Compound DC generator:</h3>
            <p>In this type of generator the field winding is connected in parallel with armature and part in series with armature.</p>
            <p>There are two types.</p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>i.	Long shunt compound generator</li>
                <li>ii.	Short shunt compound generator</li>

            </div>
            <p>In this type shunt field winding is connected across the series combination of armature and series field winding as shown in the diagram.</p>
            <p>Voltage and current relationship is,</p>
            \[{I_A} = {I_{sh}} + {I_L}\]
            <p>And</p>
            \[{I_A} = {I_{se}}\]
            <p>Voltage across shunt field winding is Vt.</p>
            \[{I_{sh}} = \frac{{{V_t}}}{{{R_{sh}}}}\]
            <p>Voltage equation is,</p>
            \[E = {V_t} + {I_A}{R_A} + {I_A}{R_{se}} + {V_{brush}}\]
            \[E = {V_t} + {I_A}\left( {{R_A} + {R_{se}}} \right) + {V_{brush}}\]
            <h4>ii) Short shunt compound generator:</h4>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/dcm/short_shunt_DC_compound_generator.png" alt="Short shunt compound generator" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            </div>
            <p>In short shunt compound generator shunt field winding is connected only across the armature excluding series field winding as shown in the diagram.</p>
            <p>Voltage and current relationship is,</p>
            \[{I_A} = {I_{se}} + {I_{sh}}\]
            <p>And</p>
            \[{I_{sc}} = {I_L}\]
            <p>Therefore,</p>
            \[{I_A} = {I_L} + {I_{sh}}\]
            <p>Voltage drop across shunt field winding is,</p>
            \[E - {I_A}{R_A} - {V_{brush}}\]
            \[{I_{sh}} = \frac{{E - {I_A}{R_A} - {V_{brush}}}}{{{R_{sh}}}}\]
            <p>The voltage equation is,</p>
            \[E = {V_t} + {I_A}{R_A} + {I_{se}}{R_{se}} + {V_{brush}}\]
            \[E = {V_t} + {I_A}{R_A} + {I_L}{R_{se}} + {V_{brush}}\]
            <p>Therefore,</p>
            \[E - {I_A}{R_A} - {V_{brush}} = {V_t} + {I_L}{R_{sc}}\]
            <h4>Differential compound generator:</h4>
            <p>In this generator two windings are wound in such a direction that the fluxes produced by them opposes each other.</p>
