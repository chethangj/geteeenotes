        </ul>
        <h3>Sources of energy available in nature:</h3>
        <p>The various sources of energy is classified into two types.</p>
        <h3>1. Conventional source of energy:</h3>
        <p>The energy source which once used and cannot be reused any more such energy source are depleting in nature.</p>
        <p><b>Example:</b> Fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas, crude oil etc.</p>
        <h3>2. Non-Conventional source of energy:</h3>
        <p>The energy source which are available in nature abundantly and can be reused again and again.</p>

        </ul>
        <h3>Hydro Electric Power Plant:</h3>
        <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/epg/HEPP_Blocks.png" alt="Hydro Electric Power Plant" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;">
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>The hydro power plant converts the energy stored in water (Potential energy) into electrical power with the help of water turbines coupled with an alternator.</li>
            <li>The power stations where electricity is produces by using the energy of flowing water to drive generators is called hydroelectric power plant.</li>
            <li>The water is stored in large reservoir behind the dam gets potential energy in it.</li>
            <li>Then the water falls from a high level of a dam its flows at a very high speed, and then the potential energy of water gets converted into kinetic energy.</li>
            <li>The kinetic energy of flowing water rotates the blades of the turbine. Here the kinetic energy of flowing water is converted into mechanical energy of the turbine.</li>
            <li>The mechanical energy of the turbine is used to drive the alternator which converts mechanical energy into an electrical energy.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Factors to be considered for selection of site for hydroelectric power plant:</h3>
        <h4>1. Availability of water:</h4>
        <p>Availability of huge quantity of water is main consideration because water is basic requirement of the hydroelectric power plant.</p>
        <h4>2. Storage of water:</h4>
        <p>There is a wide variation of water supply so storage of eater is mainly required by constructing dam to generate the power throughout the year.</p>
        <h4>3. Head of water:</h4>
        <p>To have sufficient head, the dam or reservoir should be constructed at a height on a hilly area and water turbine locates at the base of hills.</p>
        <h4>4. Cost and type of land:</h4>
        <p>The land must be available at a reasonable price. The type of the land must be such that it should with stand the weight of heavy equipments installed and the site should be away from the earth quake center.</p>
        <h4>5. Distance from load center:</h4>
        <p>The load center is connected to site by the transmission lines hence the distance of the site from the load centers should be minimum so as to keep,</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keep the cost of transmission line minimum.</li>
            <li>Keep the losses occur in the line minimum.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>6. Transportation facility:</h4>
        <p>For easy transportation of necessary equipments and machines the site should be easily accessible by road and rail.</p>
        <h3>Classification of hydroelectric power plant:</h3>
        <p>Hydroelectric power plants are broadly classified as follows.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Based on availability of water head.
            <ol type="i">
                <li>Low head power plant</li>
                <li>Medium head power plant</li>
                <li>High head power plant</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Based on quantity of water available.
            <ol type="i">
                <li>Run-off river without pondage</li>
                <li>Run-off river with pondage</li>
                <li>Reservoir</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Based on load.
            <ol type="i">
                <li>Base load power plant</li>
                <li>Peak load power plant</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Layout diagram of HEPP and main components of HEPP:</h3>
        <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/epg/HEPP.png" alt="Hydro Electric Power Plant" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;">
        </div>
        <h4>1. Dam:</h4>
        <p>It is a structure constructed across the river in a suitable location. Dams are also built in top of the hills. Dams are constructed using common material like cement, stones, earth rock pieces and RCC (Rain forced cement), concrete. The dam should be capable of resisting the pressure of water under all conditions. The primary function of dam is to provide water head. It also creates pondage or storage.</p>
        <h4>2. Spill way:</h4>
        <p>Spill way is considered as a safety for a dam. Sometimes during heavy rain fall due to river flow storage capacity of dam gets exceeded. To discharge the excess water from the reservoir to the generate electricity spill way is used.</p>
        <h4>3. Fore bay:</h4>
        <p>Fore bay is provided at the beginning of the penstock as a water reservoir. The fore way draws the water from the main reservoir through open channel or tunnel. Fore bay also stores the rejected water when the load on the turbine is decreases.</p>
        <h4>4. Trash rock:</h4>
        <p>It provides to stop the energy of the debris (waste particles) which might damage the gates and turbine blades. It is placed across the intake of water from the reservoir to the dam.</p>
        <h4>5. Penstock:</h4>
        <p>A pipe between surge tank and prime mover is known as penstock. It is closed system of taking water from intake of fore bay to the turbine. Penstock pipes are generally made of concrete pipe or steel pipe. Steel pipes are used for high and medium head power plant. The concrete pipe is used for low head power plant.</p>
        <h4>6. Prime mover (Turbine):</h4>
        <p>The main purpose of prime mover is to convert kinetic energy of water into mechanical energy. The commonly used water turbines are pelton wheel, Kaplan, Francis turbines etc.</p>
        <h4>7. Alternator:</h4>
        <p>An alternator is an electrical generator that converts mechanical energy into an electrical enery in the form of AC. They are highly efficient and easily controllable.</p>
        <h4>8. Reservoir:</h4>
        <p>It is basic requirement to hydroelectric power plant. Its purpose is store the water which is further used for power generation by running water turbines. It stores water during rainy season and supply during dry season.</p>
        <h4>9. Surge tank:</h4>
        <p>The load on the generator keeps of fluctuating therefore the water intake to the turbine will be regulated. It is provided to act as a release wall of the water conduct system. From the effect of water hammering when an additional storage is place near the turbine which stores the water during the load on the turbine is reduced and releases the water when sudden increase in load is required.</p>
        <h4>10. Catchment area:</h4>
        <p>The area of land where rain water converges at the exit of basin from where its joins another water body like river, reservoir, Lake Etc.</p>
        <h4>11. Draft tube:</h4>
        <p>An air tight pipe attached to the runner and conducting the water down from the wheel and discharging it under the surface of tail race. The pressure at the exit of the runner of the reaction turbine is generally less. Thus the water at the exit of the turbine cannot be directly discharged to the tail race. A pipe is gradually increasing area is used for discharging water from the exit of the turbine to the tail race.</p>
        <h3>Low Head Power Plant:</h3>
        <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/epg/Low_Head_HEPP.png" alt="Low Head Power Plant" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;">
        </div>
        <p>When the water head us above 30 â€“ 70 m then such plants are called now head power plants.</p>
        <p>The low head power plant stores water by constructing dam across the river to provide necessary water head the power is installed or located near the base of the dam. In such type of plant a surge tank is not required. In these types of power plant Francis turbine or Kaplan turbine is employed. At the downstream side the tail race is joined to the river.</p>
        <h3>Medium Head Power Plant:</h3>
        <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/epg/Medium_Head_HEPP.png" alt="Medium Head Power Plant" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;">
        </div>
        <p>When the operating head of water is between 70 to 300 m then such plants are called medium head power plants.</p>
        <p>The fore bay provides at the beginning of the penstock serves as water reservoir. In this plant the water is generally carried by open channel from the main reservoir to the fore bay and then to the power house through penstock. In this type of plants Francis or propeller type turbines are used.</p>
        <h3>High Head Power Plant:</h3>
        <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/epg/High_Head_HEPP.png" alt="High Head Power Plant" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;">
        </div>
        <p>The plant operating at the head is 300m and 300m above are generally classified as high head power plants.</p>
        <p>The dam and spill way are separated thus surface water discharged by spill way cannot affected the stability of main dam.</p>
        <p>The water from dam is carries into channel through mountain to the surge tank. The surge tank controls the flow of water using head gates. From the surge tank water is carry to turbines using penstock.</p>
        <p>The construction of surge tank is just before the valve house which reduces water hammer effect on the penstock. In case of sudden closing of gates at the turbine causes hammer effect. In this type of power plant generally pelting wheel turbines are used.</p>
        <h3>Base Load Power Plant:</h3>
        <p>A hydroelectric power plant works as a base load. If there is a continuous power generation that is they supply constant load throughout the year.</p>
        <p>Base load plants are usually of large capacity. The load factor of such plants is significantly higher. The run-off river and storage type plants are used as base load plants.</p>
        <h3>Peak Load Power Plant:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Run-off river with pondage are generally used as peak load power plants which can be used to generate or meet peak power.</li>
            <li>Those are generally run only when there is a high demand known as peak demand for electricity.</li>
            <li>Because they supply power only occasionally. Power supply for a much higher price per kilowatt hour than base load power. Such plants have load factor lower or less compared with that of base load plants.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Run off River Plant without Pondage:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This type of plant does not store water and it can use water when it is available.</li>
            <li>This type of plant has no control over the flow of river.</li>
            <li>The power generating capacity of the plant depends on rate of flow of water.</li>
            <li>As there is no control over water flow water is wasted during heavy rain fall and at low load conditions.</li>
            <li>During dry season rate of flow of water is very low thus the capacity of power generation reduces significantly.</li>
            <li>Such a plant sometimes is used to supply base load plants with a condition of minimum flow of water is maintained.</li>
            <li>The main drawback of such plant is non-uniformity of water supply.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Run-off River Plant with Pondage:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Limitation of Run-off River without pondage is overcome by using pondage to increase the utility of the plant to generator extent.</li>
            <li>In this type of power plant, pond permits to store water during half peak hours and used during peak hours of same day.</li>
            <li>This plant can be used as base load or peak load power plant.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Reservoir:</h3>
        <p>Most of the hydroelectric power plant belongs to this type. When the water stored in big reservoir behind the dam, it is possible to control the flow of water and use it most effectively. The main advantage of such plant is that it can be used throughout the year effectively with better capacity.</p>
        <h3>Water Hammer and its Effects:</h3>
        <p>The sudden change of water pressure above the normal is known as water hammer. Water hammering is takes place in the penstock when the abnormal surges are created in the penstock. There is a time when the load on the turbine decreases suddenly high amount of water rushed back towards the penstock immediately abnormal surges are created and there is water hammering is created and its effects on the penstock interns of busting.</p>
        <h3>Advantages of Hydroelectric Power Plant:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The maintenance cost of power plant is very low.</li>
            <li>There is free form air pollution.</li>
            <li>HEPP have very high efficiency.</li>
            <li>The cost of production of electricity is very less.</li>
            <li>The HEPP doesnâ€™t require any fuel hence the operating cost is low.</li>
            <li>The useful life of a HEPP is around 50 years.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Disadvantages of Hydroelectric Power Plant:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Due to the construction of dam and reservoir large portion of area is used for water storing and which leads to the environmental and social problems.</li>
            <li>Availability of water varies from year to year which affects the generation of power.</li>
            <li>It takes long time to construct hydroelectric power plant such has dam, power house, penstock etc.</li>
            <li>Building power plant in general is expensive.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 style="text-align: center">THERMAL POWER PLANT</h3>
        <h4>Introduction:</h4>
        <p>Thermal energy is the major source of power generation in India. In thermal power plant heat energy is converted into mechanical energy and then to an electrical energy through turbine generator system.</p>
        <h3>Working principle of energy conversion in thermal power plant:</h3>
        <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/epg/Working_Principle_of_Energy_Conversion_in_TPP.png" alt="Working principle of energy conversion in thermal power plant" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;">
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>In the thermal power plant the steam is produced in the boiler (by burning coal) using fossil fuel (coal combustion).</li>
            <li>The steam produced is then expanded on the steam turbine which converts heat energy into mechanical energy. The mechanical energy of turbine drives the alternator and converts it into an electrical energy.</li>
            <li>The exhausted steam is fed back to boiler through condenser. The condenser converts exhausted steam into water.</li>
            <li>The condenser steam is fed back to the boiler again to complete the cycle of the power station. This process is called as rankine cycle.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Selection of site for thermal power plant:</h3>
        <h4>1. Availability of fuel:</h4>
        <p>The fuel used for most of the thermal power plant is coal. For power generation in such plant a huge amount of coal is required every day. Thus the power station should be located near the coal mine.</p>
        <h4>2. Type and cost of land:</h4>
        <p>The land must be available at a reasonable price. The type of the land must be such that it should withstand the weight of heavy equipments to be installed. The site should be sufficiently away from the earth quake center.</p>
        <h4>3. Availability of water:</h4>
        <p>The power plant needs large amount of water for various purposes like for generating steam, for disposing ash etc. so the plant should be located near water sources like river, lake or channel.</p>
        <h4>4. Transportation facility:</h4>
        <p>The site should be accessible by roads and rails for transporting the required equipments of the plant.</p>
        <h4>5. Availability of labour:</h4>
        <p>During plant installation, operation sufficient labour should be available at cheaper rate.</p>
        <h4>6. Ash disposal facility:</h4>
        <p>The ash produced after burning coal is in hot condition and very corrosive effect on atmospheric, pollution creates serious health problems to human. There must be sufficient space available for disposal of large quantity of ash.</p>
        <h4>7. Distance from populated area:</h4>
        <p>Due to continuous burning of coal at power station surrounding areas gets polluted due to smoke and ash hence the site of the plant should be away from the populated area.</p>
        <h4>8. Nearness to load center:</h4>
        <p>The plant should be located as near as possible to the load center so that transmission coast and transmission losses both are minimized.</p>

        <h4>1. Coal storage:</h4>
        <p>In TPP, coal is used as a main fuel. The coal is stored in coal storage plant. The coal storage helps to supply load continuously in conditions such as strikes of coal mines, failure of transportation, shortage of coal etc.</p>
        <h4>2. Coal handling:</h4>
        <p>From the coal storage plant, coal is transfer to the coal handling plant. The coal handling plant transfers big pieces of coal into pulverized coal (i.e., crushed into small pieces) to the boiler. Because of pulverization which helps in rapid combustion of coal without requiring large quantity of air.</p>
        <h4>3. Ash handling:</h4>
        <p>Due to continuous combustion of coal large quantity of ash is produced in the boiler. For proper combustion of coal the ash produced is removed to as handling plant.</p>
        <h4>4. Ash storage:</h4>
        <p>From the ash handling plant the ash is transferred to ash storage plant where it is disposed.</p>
        <h4>5. Boiler:</h4>
        <p>A closed vessel in which steam is produced from water by combustion of fuel. Boiler is also called as steam generator.</p>
        <h4>6. Super heater:</h4>
        <p>The steam produced in the boiler contains suspended water particles and it is called wet steam. Such a wet steam is converted to super heater drive steam using the super heat of flue gases in super heater. Thus overall efficiency increases also it avoids corrosion of turbine blades due to wet steam. The super-heated steam is passed to turbine through a main valve.</p>
        <h4>7. Economizer:</h4>
        <p>The water from feed pumps is passed to boiler drum through the economizer. So before entering water into boiler drum, the water is heated. So less efforts are required to convert water into steam. Due to economizer boiler efficiency is increases. Thus saves fuel and reduces stress on the boiler.</p>
        <h4>8. Air preheater:</h4>
        <p>The air required for combustion is drawn from atmosphere and supplied to the air preheater (The air preheater extracts heat from flue gases and makes the air hot) before entering into boiler. Thus temperature of furnace increases and it helps in steam generation.</p>
        <h4>9. Steam turbine:</h4>
        <p>The super-heated steam from super heater is supplied to the steam turbine. As the steam passes over the turbine blades the heat energy of the steam is converted into the mechanical energy.</p>
        <h4>10. Alternator:</h4>
        <p>The alternator is coupled to the turbine on the same shaft. When the turbine rotates alternator shaft also rotates and converts the mechanical energy into electrical energy.</p>
        <h4>11. Feed water system:</h4>
        <p>The condensate water from the condenser is used as the feed water. The water going to boiler is first heated in a closed feed water heater then further heated by economizer. This increases overall efficiency of the plant.</p>
        <h4>12. Condenser:</h4>
        <p>To increase the plant efficiency the steam coming out of the turbine (exhausted steam) is passed to the boiler through condenser. It condenses steam into water. It creates low pressure at the turbine exhaust.</p>
        <h4>13. Cooling water system:</h4>
        <p>To condense a steam, natural cold water is circulated through the condenser. The exhausted system is cooled by cooling water system.</p>
        <h4>14. Draught system:</h4>
        <p>The draught is the process of supplying necessary air for combustion and removing the products of combustion continuously. The draught produces in the chimney is known as natural draught and draught produced by any other means called artificial draught or mechanical draught. In mechanical draught system it may consists induced draught or forced draught system or both.</p>
        <h4>Induced draught system:</h4>
        <p>In an induced draught system the blower is installed near the base of the chimney and the burned gases are sucked out of the boiler and reduces the pressure inside he boiler to less than atmospheric pressure. This induces fresh air into the furnace.</p>
        <h4>Forced draught system:</h4>
        <p>The blower is installed near the base of the boiler. In this system air pressure throughout the system is about the atmospheric pressure and air is forced to flow through the system.</p>
