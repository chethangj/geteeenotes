        <h2>CHAPTER 02 : Fuse and Circuit Breakers</h2>
            <h3>Switchgear</h3>
            <p>He apparatus used for switching, controlling and protecting the electrical circuit or electrical equipment is known as switchgear.</p>
            <p>The switch gear equipment’s are essentially concerned with switching and interrupting the current either under the normal or abnormal operating condition.</p>
            <h3>Essential features of switchgear:</h3>
            <h3>1. Complete reliability:</h3>
            <p>The switchgear which is added to the power system is mainly to increase the reliability of the power system. When faults occur on any of part of the power system, the switchgear must operate to isolate the faulty section from the power system.</p>
            <h3>2. Absolute certain discrimination:</h3>
            <p>When faults occurs on any section of the power system the switchgear must be able to discriminate (differentiate) between faulty section and healthy section. It should isolate the fault section from the system without affecting the healthy section.</p>
            <h3>3. Quick operation:</h3>
            <p>When faults occurs on any part of the power system the switchgear must operate quickly so that no damage is caused o the generator, transformer and other equipments by SC currents. If the fault is not cleared quickly then the healthy part of the power system will be damaged and thus the system will be completely shut down.</p>
            <h3>4. Provision for manual control:</h3>
            <p>Switchgear must have provision for manual control. In case of electrical control fails then the necessary operation will be carried out through manual control.</p>
            <h3>5. Provision for instruments:</h3>
            <p>There must be provision for adding on industrial where ever necessary in the system. Such as ammeters, voltmeters, CT, PT which can be connected to the main switch board or a separate instrument panel.</p>
            <h3>The different switchgear equipments used for switching and interrupting of current:</h3>
            <p>Switchgear covers the wide range of equipment concerned with switching and interrupting the current under both normal and abnormal condition.</p>
            <p>The following are the switchgear equipments used for both switching and interrupting the current.</p>

            <h4>2. Fuse:</h4>
            <p>A fuse is a protective device which is having a short piece of wire or thin strip which melts when excessive current flows through it for sufficient time. Fuse is always connected in series with the circuit to protect the system.</p>
            <h4>3. Circuit breaker:</h4>
            <p>A circuit breaker is equipment which can open or close the circuit under normal condition or abnormal condition that is no load, full load and fault condition. It is operate manually under normal condition and automatically under abnormal condition.</p>
            <h4>4. Relay:</h4>
            <p>Relay is a device which detects the faults and supply information to the circuit breaker in the power system.</p>
            <h4>5. Earthing switch:</h4>
            <p>Earthing switch is closed after the opening an isolator to discharge the charges or leakage current to the earth.</p>
            <h4>6. Surge Arrestors:</h4>
            <p>It is a device which is used to discharge the lightning surges and switching surges to the earth.</p>
            <h4>7. CT and PT:</h4>
            <p>These are used to measure the high range of voltage and current and also to step up or step down the voltage or current.</p>
            <h4>8. Bus Bar:</h4>
            <p>It is a device used to flow the current at specific voltage.</p>

            <h3>Characteristics of fuse elements:</h3>
            <p>The fuse elements should possess the following desirable characteristics.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It should have low melting point.</li>
                <li>It should have low ohmic losses.</li>
                <li>It should have high conductivity.</li>

                <li>Fuse elements are having low cost.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Note:</b> Oxidization: when oxygen is combined with an element due to this appearance of the element changes.</p>
            <h3>Fuse element materials:</h3>
            <p>Lead, Tin, Copper, Zinc, Aluminum and Silver are the most commonly used materials for fuse elements.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>For small currents up to 20 amps Tin or an alloy of lead and tin is used for making the fuse elements.</li>
                <li>During over loads normally Zinc materials are used because zinc strip do not melt quickly.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Types of fuses:</h3>
            <p>The fuses are broadly classified into 2 types.</p>

                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Important terms related to fuse:</h3>
            <h4>Current rating of fuse element:</h4>
            <p>It is the current which the fuse element can carry without over heating or melting. This depends upon temperature rise within the limits at the fuse holder of the fuse.</p>
            <h4>Fusing current:</h4>
            <p>It is the minimum value of current at which the fuse elements of the fuse wire is melts.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Its value is more than the current rating of the fuse element.</li>
                <li>For a ground wire the approximate value of a fusing current is given by I=kd^(3⁄2)<br>Where, k = fusing constant.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Fusing factor:</h4>
            <p>It is the ration of minimum fusing current to the current rating of fuse element.</p>
            <div style="overflow-x: auto">
                \[Fusing\;Factor = \;\frac{{Minimum\;Fusing\;Current}}{{Current\;Rating\;of\;Fuse}}\]
            </div>
            <p>It is always greater than one.</p>
            <h4>Prospective current:</h4>
            <p>It is defined as the RMS value of current which would flow in a circuit immediately blowing the fuse when a SC occurs assuming that the fuse has been replace by a link of negligible resistance.</p>
            <h4>Cut off current:</h4>
            <p>It is the maximum current value of fault current actually rears before the fuse is melt.</p>
            <h4>Pre arching time:</h4>
            <p>This the time between the commencement of current which is tents to cause a break in a fuse element and the current becomes permanently zero.</p>
            <h4>Total operating time:</h4>
            <p>This is the sum of the pre arching time and arching time.</p>
            <h4>Breaking capacity:</h4>
            <p>Breaking capacity of a fuse is the rating corresponding to the RMS value of the AC component of the maximum prospective current and system voltages. </p>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/sgp/Breaking_Capacity.jpg" alt="Cut-off Characteristics of Fuse" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;">
            </div>
            <h3>High reputing capacity (HRC) cartridge fuse:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/sgp/HRC.png" alt="HRC Fuse" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            </div>
            <p><b>Construction:</b><br>The HRC fuse consists of a bras metallic end cap, fuse element, bimetallic thermal control, fuse link contact, filling powder and cartridge. The above diagram shows the HRC fuse which consisting of a heat resisting ceramic body having metallic end caps to which a current carrying fuse element.</p>
            <p>The space within the body surrounding the element is completely packed with a filling powder. The filling material may be chalk, quartz, marble dust which acts as an arch quenching and as cooling medium.</p>
            <p><b>Working:</b></p>
            <p>Under normal load condition the fuse element is at a temperature bellow its melting point. Therefore it carries normal current without overheating.</p>
            <p>When faults occur that is during abnormal condition the current increases and fuse element melts due to rise in temperature before the fault current reaches its peak value.</p>
            <p><b>Example:</b> The heat is produced in this process vaporizes the melted silver element. The chemical reaction between the silver vapor and the filling powder results in the formation of high resistance substance and thus it helps in quenching the arc.</p>
            <h3>Advantages of HRC fuse:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It has high speed of operation.</li>
                <li>No maintenance is required.</li>
                <li>These are comparatively cheaper to circuit breakers and relays.</li>
                <li>They are quiet reliable and provides proper discrimination.</li>
                <li>They have inverse time characteristics.</li>
                <li>They are capable of clearing low and high faults currents.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Disadvantages of HRC fuse:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The fuse must be replaced after each operation it takes some time.</li>
                <li>It produces overheating of the adjacent contacts.</li>
                <li>Inter locking is not possible (that is the heat produced by the arc may affect the other switches).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Types of HRC fuse:</h3>
            <p>It is broadly classifies into 3 types.</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>NH type HRC fuse</li>
                <li>Din type HRC fuse</li>
                <li>Blade type HRC fuse</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Applications of HRC fuse:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It is used in protection of transformers, motors, generators, auto mobile etc.,.</li>
                <li>It is also used in motor starters.</li>
                <li>It gives backup protection to the system.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Circuit Breaker:</h3>
            <p>It is protective device it can be used for making or breaking the circuit. It is a mechanical device designed to close or open the contacts. Thus closing and opening of a circuit breaker in an electrical circuit depends upon normal or abnormal condition (fault condition).</p>
            <p>A circuit breaker will make or break a circuit either manually or automatically under different conditions such as no load, full load and short circuit.</p>
            <h3>Arch formation process:</h3>
            <p>When a short circuit occur a heavy current flows through the circuit breaker before they are open by the protective system. At that instant when conduct begins to separate, the contacts are decreases rapidly and large fault current causes increase in current density and temperature increases. The heat produced in the medium between the contacts (usually the medium is air or oil) is sufficient to ionize or vaporize the oil. The ionized air or vapor acts as a conductor and an arc is struck between the contacts. The potential difference between the contacts is quiet small and is just sufficient to maintain the arc. This arc provides a low resistance path and consequently the current in the circuit remains uninterruptable so as long as the arc persists.</p>
            <p>The arch phenomena depends upon,</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The nature and pressure of the medium.</li>
                <li>The nature, shape and separation of electrodes.</li>
                <li>The voltage across the electrodes and its variation with time.</li>
                <li>The external ionizing and deionizing against present.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Methods of arc extinction:</h3>
            <p>There are 2 methods of arc extinguishing the arching circuit. They are,</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>High Resistance Method</li>
                <li>Low Resistance Method or Current Zero Method</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>1. High resistance method:</h3>
            <p>In high resistance method the arc resistance is increased with time. This will reduce the current so as a value which will be insufficient to maintain the arc. Thus the current is interrupted and arc is extinguished. This method is employed only in DC circuit breakers. The resistance may be increased by lengthening the arc, cooling the arc, reducing cross section of arc and splitting the arc.</p>
            <h3>2. Low resistance method:</h3>
            <p>This method is employed for arc extinction in AC circuit breakers. In this method the arc resistance is kept low until current reaches to zero where extinction of arc takes place naturally and its prevented from restricking. This method is employed in many of the modern AC circuit breakers.</p>
            <h3>Working of the circuit breaker by trip circuit mechanism:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/sgp/CB_Trip_Mechanism.png" alt="Basic Operation of CB of trip ckt mechanism" style="width: 100%; max-width: 550px;">
            </div>
            <p>The above figure shows the diagram of circuit breaker. It mainly consisting of two contacts that is fixed contact and a moving contact. A handle is attached at the end of moving or sliding contact. It can be operated manually or automatically.</p>
            <p>The automatic operation needs a separate mechanism which consists of a trip coil. The trip coil is energized by secondary of current transformer. The terminals of the circuit breaker are brought to the power supply.</p>
            <p>Under normal working condition the emf produced in the secondary winding of the CT is not sufficient to energize the trip coil to complete the circuit breaker operation. Thus the contact remains in close position carrying the normal working current but the contacts can be open manually by the handle.</p>
            <p>Under abnormal or fault condition high current flows in the primary winding of the CT which induces high emf in the secondary of the CT. so that the trip coil is energized, due to this the contacts will starts to open. The contacts are moved towards right away from the fixed contact.</p>
            <h3>Important terms of circuit breaker:</h3>
            <h4>1. Arching time:</h4>
            <p>This is the time between the end of processing time and the instant when the circuit is broken and the current becomes permanently zero.</p>
            <p>Or</p>
            <p>It is an interval of time between the instant of initiation of the arc in a fuse and at the instant final arc extinction is seen in a fuse.</p>
            <h4>2. Pre-arching time:</h4>
            <p>This is the time between the commencement of current which tents to cause a break in a fuse element and the instant of the arc is initiated.</p>
            <h4>3. Prospective current:</h4>
            <p>It is defined as the rms value of current which would flow in a circuit immediately blowing the fuse when a SC occurs assuming that the fuse has been replaced by a link of negligible resistance.</p>
            <h4>4. Arc voltage:</h4>
            <p>It is the voltage that appears across the contacts of the circuit breaker during the arching period.</p>
            <h4>5. Recovery voltage:</h4>
            <p>It is the voltage which appears across the terminals of each pole of a circuit breaker immediately after breaking the circuit.</p>
            <h4>6. Transient recovery voltage (TRV):</h4>
            <p>When interrupting a fault at the circuit breaker terminal in an inductive circuit the supply voltage and current zero, at that time the power in pot is maximum and the voltage on the supply side terminal reaches in transient process. Hence it is called transient recovery voltage.</p>
            <h4>7. Rate of rise of recovery voltage or restricking voltage:</h4>
            <p>It is defined as the resultant transient voltage which appears across the circuit breaker contacts at the instant of arc extinction.</p>
            <h4>8. Total break time:</h4>
            <p>Fault clearing time is the sum of relay time and circuit breaker time is called total operating time.</p>
            <h3>Circuit breaker rating:</h3>
            <p>The ratings of the circuit breaker is given according to the duties perform by it. The circuit breaker mainly requires performing three major duties or factors under short circuit condition.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A circuit breaker must be capable of breaking the circuit and isolating the faulty section in case of fault. This is normally called as breaking capacity of the circuit breaker.</li>
                <li>It must be capable of closing the fault points hence it is called making capacity of the circuit breaker.</li>
                <li>Circuit breaker must be capable of clearing the fault current for a short time, while another circuit breaker is clearing the faults. This is referred as short time capacity of the circuit breaker.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Classification of circuit breaker:</h3>
            <p>Circuit breakers are broadly classified into 2 types.</p>
            <p>1)	Classification of circuit based on the ratings of voltage.</p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>Low voltage rating circuit breaker</li>
                <li>High voltage rating circuit breaker</li>
            </ol>
            <p>2)	Classification of circuit breaker based on the medium of arc extinction.</p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>Oil circuit breaker (OCB)</li>
                <li>Air circuit breaker (ACB)</li>
                <li>SF6 circuit breaker</li>
                <li>Vacuum circuit breaker (VCB)</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Oil circuit breaker:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/sgp/OCB.png" alt="OCB" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;">
            </div>
            <p>The plain break OCB is the oldest type compared to all other circuit breakers. It is having very simple construction which operates normally when the fixed and moving contact of the circuit breaker carries the normal circuit current.</p>
            <p>When faults occurs the moving contacts are separated at full load and an arc is struck between the contacts and vaporizes the oil into hydrogen (H2) gas. The arc is extended. It is removed by the following reasons. Due to the hydrogen gas bubbles are generated which surrounded the arc region fails to keep the contact closer. This will interrupt the fault current and arc is extinguished between two contacts. Finally displace oil comes back to its original position and contact of the circuit breaker separated from the contacts which increases length of the contacts.</p>
            <h3>Advantages of OCB:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The arc energy is easily absorbed by the oil due to its decomposition.</li>
                <li>The gases from due to arc extinction within the contacts this helps for cooling properties.</li>
                <li>The cooling surfaces forward by the surrounding oil will completely reduce the arc.</li>
                <li>The oil used here act as an insulator and which has dielectric strength.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Disadvantages of OCB:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>This type of circuit breaker does not permit high interruption on speed.</li>
                <li>This type of circuit breakers have long consistence on arc.</li>
                <li>There is no special control on the arc other than increasing the length of the contacts.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Applications of OCB:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It is used for the medium and high voltage applications.</li>
                <li>Used for the protection of plants, electrical machines, transformers, generators.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Air Circuit Breaker:</h3>
            <p>Air circuit breakers are broadly classified into 2 types.</p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>Axial blast air circuit breakers</li>
                <li>Cross blast air circuit breakers</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>1. Axial Blast Air Circuit Breaker:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/sgp/Axial_Blast_ACB.png" alt="Axial Blast ACB" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            </div>
            <p>In axial blast, air is directed along the arc axillary. In cross blast type the air is directed at right angle to the arc path and in case of radial blast type the air is directed radially. The above figure shows the axial blast air circuit breaker.</p>
            <p>In the axial blast air circuit breaker the fixed and moving contacts are placed in a closed position at high pressure. Under normal condition the air receiver is connected to the arching chamber through the air valve. This valve remain closed under normal condition and it open automatically when the system is in abnormal condition or when fault occur in a system.</p>
            <p>When a fault occurs the air valve will be opened by tripping mechanism which is connected to the air receiver to the arching chamber. The high pressured air entering the arching chamber which pushes away the moving contact against the fixed contact which is then separated and on arc is struck between the contacts at the same time high pressure air blast flows along the arc and takes away the ionized gases along it. Consistently the arc is extinguished and the flow of high current is interrupted.</p>
            <h3>2. Cross Blast Air Circuit Breaker:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/sgp/Cross_Blast_ACB.png" alt="Cross Blast ACB" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            </div>
            <p>In this type of circuit breaker an air blast is directed at right angles to the arc. The cross blast increases if the length of the arc increases as shown in above figure.</p>
            <p>When the moving contact is tripped on arc is struck between the contacts. Due to this high pressure cross blast air flows through the arc to split the arc which is used to split the arc in air splitters to different parts. The increased length of the contact due to this an arc is extinguished and the flow of high current is interrupted. This takes place during abnormal condition.</p>
            <h3>Advantages of Air Circuit Breaker:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The fire is eliminated by air which avoids the risk.</li>
                <li>The arching time is very small.</li>
                <li>The gap required for the arc extinction is very small. This reduces the size of the device.</li>
                <li>The energy supplied for the extinction of arc is mainly obtained from the high pressure air.</li>
                <li>The arching product is completely removed in air blast circuit breakers.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Disadvantages of Air Circuit Breakers:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Air blast circuit breakers are very sensitive due to the variation of restriking voltage.</li>
                <li>Air has less relative permeability and hence arc extinction property is also less.</li>
                <li>Maintenance is required for the compressor part.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Applications of ACB:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Air circuit breaker is used in electricity sharing system and ground about 15 KV.</li>
                <li>It is also used in low as well as high current and voltage applications.</li>
                <li>It is used for the protection of plants, electrical machines, capacitors, transformers, generators.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Sulfur Hexafluoride Circuit Breaker (SF6):</h3>
            <p>It is classified into 2 types.</p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>i.	Puffer type SF6 circuit breaker</li>
                <li>ii.	Non Puffer type SF6 circuit breaker</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>1. Puffer Type SF6 Circuit Breaker:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/sgp/SF6_CB_Puffer.jpg" alt="Puffer type SF6 CB" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;">
            </div>
            <p><b>Construction:</b></p>
            <p>The above diagram shows the typical parts of SF6 circuit breaker. It is consisting of a fixed contact, moving contact which is enclosed in chamber called as arc interruption chamber containing SF6 gas.</p>
            <p>This chamber is connected through SF6 gas reservoir. When the contacts of breaker are opened the tip mechanism permits in high pressured SF6 gas from the reservoir to flow towards an arc interruption chamber. The fixed contact and moving contact are an hallow cylinder which is containing the holes to permit the SF6 gas after flowing across the arc.</p>
            <p><b>Working:</b></p>
            <p>In closed position of the circuit breaker the contact remains surrounded by SF6 gas at a pressure of about 2.8 kg/cm2. When the circuit breaker operates the moving contacts are separated apart and an arc is struck between the contacts. The movement of moving contact is opened which permits SF6 gas at 14 kg/cm2 from the reservoir to the arc extinction chamber.</p>
            <p>The high pressured flow of SF6 gas rapidly absorbs the free electrons in the arc path, when arc is affected as charge carries. After the breaker operation, the wall (fixed position) is closed by the action of set of springs.</p>
            <h3>2. Non Puffer Type SF6 Circuit Breaker:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/sgp/SF6_CB_NonPuffer.png" alt="Non Puffer type SF6 CB" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;">
            </div>
            <p>In SF6 non puffer type circuit breaker there is a moving contact and a fixed contact, arc chamber and SF6 gas as source group to avoid the arc occurring in the system.</p>
            <p>During normal working condition the contacts are closed position which is surrounded by SF66 gas at a pressure of about 2.8 kg/cm2. When the contacts are separated than the arc is struck between the moving and fixed contacts due to this the valve is open and synchronized to permit high pressure SF6 gas from the reservoir to the arc interruption chamber. The SF6 gas of about 14 kg/cm2 pressure is send from the reservoir to the arching chamber. The high pressure gas absorbs the free electrons in the arc path to form negative ions.</p>
            <p>The gas is also removed from the arching chamber through the gas outlet, due to this arc diameter is reduced and becomes small. Hence the current is completely reduced to zero and arc is extinguished. After the breaking operation the valve is closed by set of springs.</p>
            <h3>Advantages of SF6 Circuit Breaker:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The SF6 circuit breaker has very short arching time. Due to this high dielectric strength of SF6 gas it can interrupt very high currents.</li>
                <li>It gives noiseless operation compare to the air circuit breaker.</li>
                <li>There is no risk of fire.</li>
                <li>SF6 gas is non-flammable.</li>
                <li>It requires less maintenance and no decomposition is found.</li>
                <li>These are enclosed hence they are particularly suitable when the explosion hazards are present.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Disadvantages of SF6 Circuit Breaker:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>These circuit breakers are costly due to the high cost of SF6 gas.</li>
                <li>SF6 gas as be recondition after every operation of SF6 circuit breaker. It requires some additional components for recondition of SF6 gas.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Applications of SF6 Circuit Breaker:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>SF6 circuit breakers have been use for the voltages of 11 KV to 500 KV.</li>
                <li>These circuit breakers are used for the power rating of 10 MVA – 550 MVA.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Vacuum Circuit Breaker:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/sgp/VCB.png" alt="Vacuum CB" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;">
            </div>
            <p><b>Construction:</b></p>
            <p>In this circuit breaker vacuum is used as the arc quenching medium. The vacuum offers highest dielectric strength which is shown in above figure. The main parts of vacuum circuit breaker are a fixed contact and a moving contact and a arc shield which is mounted inside a vacuum chamber. The moveable contact is connected with a control mechanism (trip mechanism) by a stainless steel bellows. These bellows enables the permanent ceiling of vacuum chamber so as to eliminate the possibility of leakage in a glass vessel which is used as the outer insulating body. The arc shield prevents the deterioration of the internal dielectric strength by preventing metallic vapors falling on the inside surface of the outer insulating vessel.</p>
            <p><b>Working:</b></p>
            <p>When the circuit breaker operates the moving contact separates from the fixed contact and the arc is struck between the contacts. The production of arc is due to the ionization of metal ions and depends upon the material of contact.</p>
            <p>The arc is quickly extinguished because of the metallic vapors; electrons and negative ions produced during the arc and which is destroy in a short time because there is no current path between the contacts of the fixed and moving contacts and also arc shield.</p>
            <p>Since vacuum has very fast rate of recovery of dielectric strength, the extinction of arc in vacuum circuit breakers occurs with a very short period of time and hence contacts are separated.</p>
            <h3>Advantages of VCB:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>These are very costly.</li>

                <li>It is uneconomical to manufacture vacuum circuit breaker in small quantity.</li>
                <li>Loss of vacuum due to damage or failure makes the entire circuit breaker as useless and which cannot be repaired at sight.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Applications of VCB:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>These are most reliable current interruption technology used for medium voltage switchgear applications.</li>
                <li>Used in porcelain housed circuit breakers.</li>
                <li>Due to short gap and excellent recovery characteristics these are useful for very high speed circuit breakers which are generally used in industrial applications.</li>
                <li>These are operated where voltages are high and interruption current is less.</li>
            </ul>
