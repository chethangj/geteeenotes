        <h2 style="line-height: 35px">CHAPTER 04 : PROTECTION OF GENERATORS AND TRANSFORMERS</h2>
        <p>In modern electrical power system it’s consisting of several elements such as generators, transformers, station bus bar, alternator etc. It is possible that one or the other type of failure may occur in these elements so it is essential to protect these elements from different types of faults.</p>
        <p>Relays are used to detect the improper behavior of these elements in the power system and to take correcting measures.</p>
        <h3>Protection of Alternator:</h3>
        <p>The important faults that occur in the alternator are,</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Stator fault</li>
            <li>Rotor fault</li>
            <li>Abnormal running condition</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>1) Stator Faults:</h4>
        <p>The stator faults is the fault occur in the armature winding of the alternator. These faults are mainly due to the failure of the insulation in the armature winding.</p>
        <p>The main types of stator faults are,</p>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>Phase to earth fault</li>
            <li>Phase to phase fault</li>
            <li>Stator inter turn fault</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>i) Phase to phase fault:</b></p>
        <p>These faults are mainly occurs in the armature slots. Therefore very dangerous and cause damage to the expensive machine. If the fault current lesser then they cause negligible burning of coil and machine is tripped quickly.</p>
        <p>But if the fault current is higher, then the burning of the stator core is takes place. So in order to avoid damage separate sensitive earth fault protection is used for the alternator along with the earthing resistance.</p>
        <p><b>ii) Phase to phase fault:</b></p>
        <p>This fault is the short circuit occurred between any two phase windings. These faults are not common because the insulation used between the coils of different phases of slots is large. But if once phase to earth fault is occurred due to the overheating phase to phase fault is also produced. These faults produces arc at copper and fire can be produced if the insulation is not fire resistance.</p>
        <p><b>iii) Stator inter turn fault:</b></p>
        <p>The coils used in the alternators are generally multi turn coils so short circuit occurred between the turns of coils which is called as inter turn fault. This fault is occurred due to the current surges with a high value of voltage across the turns. This fault may be avoided if coil used is single turn instead of multi turn.</p>
        <h4>2) Rotor faults:</h4>
        <p>The rotor of an alternator is generally a field winding type as most of the alternators are of rotating field. The field windings are made up of no. of turns so the conductor to earth fault (phase to earth fault) and short circuit between the turns (phase to phase fault) of the field winding are the common faults occurring in the rotor. These faults are mainly caused due to the mechanical and thermal stress acting on the field winding insulation.</p>
        <p>The unbalanced loading on the AC generator produces negative currents. This current produces an rms value which rotates in opposite direction to that of rotor magnetic field. Due to this field the emf in the rotor winding is increased. This causes over heating of the rotor.</p>
        <h4>3) Abnormal running conditions (or) abnormalities occur in alternator:</h4>
        <p>The abnormal running condition is caused due to the following conditions.</p>
        <p><b>i) Over loading:</b></p>
        <p>Due to the continuous over loading, the stator winding temperature will be increased. If this temperature exceeds certain limit results in the failure of the insulation.</p>
        <p><b>ii) Over speeding:</b></p>
        <p>In case of hydraulic generators a sudden loss and rise of load results in over speeding of the generator. This is because of the water flow to the turbine cannot be stopped or reduced suddenly. Hence a turbo governor is provided to prevent over speeding.</p>
        <p>But if there is failure or any fault in the turbo governor then they will be dangerous over speeding of alternators.</p>
        <p><b>iii) Unbalance loading:</b></p>
        <p>The unbalanced loading of generators results in the circulation of negative signal current. This current produces rotating magnetic field. This rotating magnetic field rotates at synchronous speed with respect to rotor but the direction of rmf is opposite to that of the synchronous speed. Thus the emf produced is also doubled if normal frequency in rotor winding. This circulating current due to induced emf is responsible to overheat the rotor winding.</p>
        <p><b>iv) Over voltage:</b></p>
        <p>The over voltages are basically due to the over speeding and also the faulty operation of voltage regulators. Not only the internal over voltages are dangerous but atmospheric surge voltages will also damage the generator.</p>
        <p>This atmospheric surge voltage is produced due to lighting strokes to the areal lines of the HV system. To protect the generators from surge voltages the surge arrestors and surge capacitors are used. At the time of restricking across the contact of the circuit breaker the transient voltages are produced. These surges are called as switching surges and this can be limited by the modern circuit breakers.</p>
        <p><b>v) Failure of prime movers:</b></p>
        <p>Failure of prime movers will results in the motoring operation of the generator. The generator draws active power from the network and continuous to run at synchronous speed but due to the failure of prime movers synchronous generators starts to operate as a synchronous motor. This may lead to the dangerous mechanical conditions. In order to prevent this fault directional power relays are used.</p>
        <p><b>vi) Loss of excitation:</b></p>
        <p>The loss of excitation or reduced excitation is possible due to the failure of field winding or faults produced in the exciter system.</p>
        <p>Due to the reduced excitation the speed of the generator is increases this leads to the overheating of stator winding and also rotor due to the increased current. To protect the alternator must be disconnected immediately. For this action the tripping scheme can be used which can trip the generator by circuit breakers when there is a field failures.</p>
        <p><b>vii) Cooling system failure:</b></p>
        <p>The failure of cooling system also causes severe overheating due to rise in temperature above the safe limit. This may lead to the failure if insulation and due to this some other faults are produced. To protect this failure thermo couplers are used to sense the temperature for large machineries.</p>
        <h3>Differential protection of alternator:</h3>
        <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/sgp/Differential_Protection_For_Alternator.png" alt="Differential protection of alternator" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;">
        </div>
        <p><b>Construction:</b></p>
        <p>The current differential protection of three phase alternator having identical CT’s that is CT<sub>1</sub> and CT<sub>2</sub> are placed on either side of each phase of the stator winding of an alternator. The secondary of each side of CT’s are connected in a star manner. The two star connection CT is being connected together by means of a pilot cable. Thus there is a independent flow of current in each pair of CT and pilot cables.</p>
        <p><b>Working:</b></p>
        <p>The relays are connected across each circulating part of the alternator. Under normal operating condition the current acts on both the ends of alternator windings will be open and hence the current in the secondary of CT will be equal and relay remains inoperative in nature.</p>
        <p>This balanced circulating current flows in each phase winding of alternator with the help of pilot cables and no current flows through the relay operating coil or R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub> under normal condition.</p>
        <p>During abnormal condition that is fault occurred between phase to phase or phase to earth fault in the windings of an alternator. Due to this unequal line current starts flowing across the ends of the stator winding of an alternator. Hence the difference in current flows to the relay operating coil this operates the relay to trip the circuit and circuit breaker will starts to operate.</p>
        <h3>Balanced Earth Fault Protection:</h3>
        <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/sgp/Balanced_Earth_Fault_Protection.png" alt="Balanced Earth Fault Protection" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;">
        </div>
        <p><b>Construction:</b></p>
        <p>The schematic arrangement of balanced earth fault protection for the three phase alternator is shown in the above figure. It is consisting of three CT’s on one side connected in three phase, all these CT’s are connected in star manner with that of single CT which is joining the stator point on either end of a three phase alternator with an earthing resistance(R). a relay is connected across the CT secondary. The protection is given against phase to earth fault with the help of trip circuit.</p>
        <p><b>Working:</b></p>
        <p>Under normal working condition, the alternator line currents are added to the 0 (equal lime currents in both the ends). Thus no current flow to the relay operating coil and relay remains inoperative. If the fault occurs F<sub>2</sub> that is outside the protection zone then the sum of the line current is exactly equal to the current in the neutral point. Thus current in the relay is zero hence relay remains inoperative.</p>
        <p>But if the fault occurs F<sub>1</sub> that is inside the protection zone then the sum of line currents of alternator is different than the current through neutral side of CT hence relay will starts to operate and trips the circuit by operating the contacts of the circuit breaker.</p>
        <h3>Stator Inter Turn Protection:</h3>
        <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/sgp/Stator_Interturn_Protection.png" alt="Stator Inter Turn Protection" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;">
        </div>
        <p><b>Construction:</b></p>
        <p>The above figure shows the schematic arrangement for circulating current inter turn protection for a three phase double wound AC generator. The relays (R<sub>C</sub>) provide protection against phase to ground faults and F is the faults produced in the stator inter turns of an alternator. Due to this fault the relays R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub> are provided for the protection of inter turn faults. The two CT’s are connected on either ends of the stator windings.</p>
        <p><b>Working:</b></p>
        <p>Under normal working condition, the stator winding (S<sub>1</sub> & S<sub>2</sub>) are carrying equal current hence same current flows in the both CT’s secondary’s that is CT1 and CT2. The secondary current around the loop is same so no current flows through the relay R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub> hence relay remains inoperative.</p>
        <p>If short circuit is produced in between the turns as shown in above figure that is between S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub>. Then the current is different in both the stator windings S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub>. Therefore this current is induced in the secondary of CT and this current flow to the relay (it may be R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>). The relay operates the tripping circuit and clear the fault produced in the alternator.</p>
        <h3>Protection of Transformers:</h3>
        <p>The transformers are static devices without having any rotating part and are totally enclosed in an oil immersed chamber hence the chance of fault occurring are much rare as compare to the faults occur in an alternators and also possibilities of running on abnormal conditions are also less in transformers compare to the generators.</p>
        <p>Thought the fault possibilities are rare, if the fault occurs in the transformer must be quickly disconnected from the system. The rare fault is not clear quickly can develop in to the major faults which may generate very serious problems to the transformer. Hence the protection must be provided to the transformer against possible faults.</p>
        <h3>Common faults in transformer:</h3>
        <p>The faults occurs in transformer are,</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open circuit fault</li>
            <li>Over heating</li>
            <li>Winding short circuit</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>1) Open Circuit Fault:</h4>
        <p>The open circuit in one of the three phase is dangerous causing of the heating of the transformer. Separate relay protection is not provided for the open circuit faults. As OC’s are much harmless compare to the other faults. On the occurrence of OC fault, the transformer can be disconnected manually from the system.</p>
        <h4>2) Over Heating:</h4>
        <p>It is caused by over loading or short circuit or by the failure of cooling system. The relay protection is not provided against this. Generally temperature indicators are provided to sense the fault and sound the alarm.</p>
        <h4>3) Winding Short Circuit Faults (Internal Faults):</h4>
        <p>This is due to the winding insulation breakdown due to overheating. At the time of this fault transformer must be disconnected quickly from the system or else causes major faults in the transformer. Therefore relay protection is necessary for internal faults.</p>
        <h3>Types of protection of transformer:</h3>
        <p>The different relays and protective systems used for the transformers are,</p>
        <h4>1) Buchholz relay device:</h4>
        <p>This device provide protection against all types of faults that is slow developing faults such as insulation failure, core heating, failure in oil level due to leakage etc.</p>
        <h4>2) Earth faults relay:</h4>
        <p>These are providing protection against earth faults only.</p>
        <h4>3) Over current relays:</h4>
        <p>These devices provide protection against phase to phase fault and over loading occurred in the transformer.</p>
        <h4>4) Differential system (or) circulating current system:</h4>
        <p>These devices provide protection against phase to earth fault and phase to phase faults.</p>
        <h3>Construction and working of Buchholz relay:</h3>
        <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/sgp/Buchholz_Relay_Arrangements.png" alt="Buchholz Relay Arrangements" style="width: 100%; max-width: 200px;">
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/sgp/Buchholz_Relay_Construction.png" alt="Buchholz Relay Construction" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
        </div>
        <p><b>Construction:</b></p>
        <p>It is consisting of two hinged floats in a metallic chamber located in the pipe connected between conservator and transformer main tank. One of the float is neared to the top of the chamber and another is connected opposite to transformer.</p>
        <p>Buchholz relay is a gas activated relay installed in a oil immersed transformer for protection against all kinds of faults. Buchholz relay give an alarm in case of slow developing faults. To disconnect the transformer from the supply during internal faults it is installed between the conservator tank and transformer main tank which is shown in the above figure (a).</p>
        <p><b>Working:</b></p>
        <p>These types of relays are generally installed in oil immersed transformer for the protection against all types of faults. The heat developed due to slow developing faults causes the decomposition of transformer oil in the main tank. The product of decomposition contains more than 70% of hydrogen gas. This gas gets acuminated on the upper parts of the relay chamber and relays are sufficient to pressurize the float to get tilted therefore the float get closer to the contacts and closes the contact of mercury switch. This completes the alarm circuit also circuit gets activated.</p>
        <p>If a serious fault is occurred in the transformer, an enormous amount of gas is generated in the main tank. This gas moves away towards conservator through the buchholz relay. Due to this the trip circuit and an alarm circuit will starts to operate.</p>
        <h4>Advantages:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>It is the simplest form of transformer protection.</li>
            <li>It gives an indication of faults at early stage due to the alarm circuit will start to operate.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>This can be used only for the oil immersed transformers which are having conservator tank.</li>
            <li>The relays give slows to operate which are having minimum operating time of 0.1 sec and average time is 0.2 sec.</li>
            <li>The faults bellow the oil level is detected.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Applications of Buchholz relay:</h4>
        <p>The following are the transformer protection given by the buchholz relay.</p>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>Local over heating</li>
            <li>Entrance of air bubblers in the oil</li>
            <li>Short circuited laminations</li>
            <li>Loss of oil and reduction in oil level</li>
            <li>Loss of electrical contacts</li>
            <li>Bushing punchers</li>
            <li>Winding earth fault</li>
            <li>Winding and phase short circuits</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Earth fault (or) leakage protection of transformer:</h3>
        <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/sgp/Earth_Fault_Or_Leakage_Protection_Of_Transformer.png" alt="Earth fault (or) leakage protection of transformer" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;">
        </div>
        <p><b>Construction:</b></p>
        <p>The three terminals of primary winding of a power transformer are taken out through the core of CT which carries single secondary winding. The operating coil of relay is connected to this secondary winding.</p>
        <p>This protection system is used only to find the earth faults in the transformer. It is also called as core balance leakage protection which is shown in above figure.</p>
        <p><b>Working:</b></p>
        <p>The partial breakdown of winding insulation to the earth gives rise to the earth fault. It results in the leakage current which is less than the short circuit current. When the earth fault continuous for long duration it turns to short circuit within the windings hence earth fault relay is used to avoid this damage. To protect transformer from earth fault core balance leakage protection is used. Under normal condition there is no fault hence the vector sum of three phase current is zero and hence no resultant flux in the core of CT is produced. Relay will not operate.</p>
        <p>If phase to earth fault is produced then vector sum of three phase current is unequal and due to this the resultant flus is setup in the core of CT which induces the emf in the secondary of CT. hence the current flows in the secondary of CT this energizes the relay operating coil to trip the circuit breaker and disconnect the fault section from the healthy section.</p>
        <h3>Circulating current scheme (or) Merz price circulating current scheme for transformer protection:</h3>
        <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/sgp/Circulating_Current_Scheme_Or_Mirzprice_Circulating_Current_Scheme_For_Transformer_Protection.png" alt="Circulating current scheme (or) Merz price circulating current scheme for transformer protection" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;">
        </div>
        <p><b>Construction:</b></p>
        <p>A merz price circulating current scheme is shown in the above figure which is having power transformer connected in both the side that is primary and secondary in delta manner and then to the neutral point N. the primary and secondary windings of transformer is connected through the pilot wire and relay coil is placed between the secondary’s of CT. this type of protection is used for power transformers against phase to phase fault and phase to earth fault.</p>
        <p><b>Working:</b></p>
        <p>Under normal condition, the secondary’s of CT’s are carrying normal currents (identical currents). Therefore current entering and current leaving through the pilot wire and at both ends of transformers are same. Hence no current flows through the relay operating coil. The relay remains inoperative in nature.</p>
        <p>If an earth fault of phase to phase fault is occurred then the current in the secondary’s of CT’s will be unequal. Hence differential current starts flowing through the relay operating coil. This will trip the circuit breaker on both the sides of CT.</p>
        <h3>Combined leakage and overload protection for transformer:</h3>
        <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/sgp/Combained_Leakage_And_Overload_Protection_For_Transformer.png" alt="Combined leakage and overload protection for transformer" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;">
        </div>
        <p>Combined leakage and overload protection for transformer provides protection when faults occur between phases of transformer and also between phases to earth. The overload relays are used having current setting and are arranged to operate against faults between phases.</p>
        <p>The above figure shows the combines leakage and overload protection for transformer arrangement. In this system of protection two overload relays and one leakage or earth relay is connected. This two overload relays are sufficient to protect against phase to phase faults. This trips the contacts of overload relay and gives protection to the transformer.</p>
        <p>Whenever the earth fault or phase to earth fault is produced earth fault relay which is connected in parallel to the overload relay will start to operate by energizing leakage relay coil and trips the circuit breaker by disconnecting fault section from the healthy section.</p>
