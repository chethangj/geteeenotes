        <h2>CHAPTER 03 : DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS</h2>
            <h3>Distribution System:</h3>
            <p>It is a part of electrical power system network which distributes electrical power to the consumers for general utilization.</p>
            <p>From generating station to the receiving station power is brought by using transmission. From secondary substation power is brought upto the consumers meter board by an electric conductor called distribution system.</p>
            <h3>Classification of distribution system:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>According to the nature of current

                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>According to the scheme of connection
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>Radial distribution system</li>

                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>According to the constructional arrangements
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>Overhead distribution system</li>
                        <li>Underground distribution system</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Single line diagram of distribution system:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/tdu/Single_Line_Diagram_of_Distribution_System.png" alt="Single line diagram of distribution system" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;">
            </div>
            <p>The distribution line can be subdivided into three parts namely,</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Feeders</li>
                <li>Second distributors</li>
                <li>Service mains</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Feeders:</h4>
            <p>Feeders are lines or conductors which connects substations and distribution substation or localized generating station to the area where electrical power is to be distributed.</p>
            <p>Generally loading current of a feeder uniform along the length of the line since no tapings are taken from the feeder. The feeder carries current in large capacity and design of a feeder mainly depends on the current to be carried. The feeder lines can be overhead and underground.</p>
            <h4>Distributor:</h4>
            <p>Distributors are the line or conductors which run along streets to be supply electrical power to the consumers.</p>
            <p>The numbers of tapings are taken from the distributors for supplying electrical power to the consumer. Hence current in the distributors is non-uniform. It varies along its length of the line. While designing the distributor lines voltage drop is considered as a main factor.</p>
            <h4>Service mains:</h4>
            <p>The service mains are the connecting link between nearby distributor and consumer terminals. For service main insulated cable is used and it may be UG or OH.</p>
            <h3>Radial Distribution System:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/tdu/Radial_Distribution_System.png" alt="Radial Distribution System" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;">
            </div>
            <p>In radial system of distribution no. of separate feeders are radiated from common single substation/ hence it is called radial system.</p>
            <p>There is combination of one distributor fed by one feeder connecting that feeder to the substation.</p>
            <p>In the above figure distributor one is connected only at one end of substation through a feeder at point a similarly the other feeder is feeding the distributor two only at one point B.</p>
            <p>Due to such system, if the fault occurs either on feeder or a distributor, all the consumers connected to that distributor will get affected. They would be an interruption of supply to all such consumers.</p>
            <p>Similarly the end of the distributor near to the substation will get heavily loaded than the end which is too far away from the substation.</p>
            <p>Similarly the consumers at the end of the distributor would be subjected to the voltage fluctuations has the load on distributor changes.</p>
            <p>This type of distribution system is used for low voltage, medium density load areas and where substation is located at the center of the load.</p>
            <h4>Advantages of Radial Distribution System:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Simple in construction and circuit arrangements.</li>
                <li>Useful when the generator is at low voltage.</li>
                <li>Initial cost is low.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Disadvantages of Radial Distribution System:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>This system suitable for short distance distribution only.</li>
                <li>When load variation on the distribution takes places, there is a serious voltage fluctuation for consumers at the far end of the distribution.</li>
                <li>The consumers attached to one feeder and one distributor depends only on the reliability of that feeder and distributor. If any fault takes place in that feeder or distributor it cuts off supply to the all consumers.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Ring Main Distribution System:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/tdu/Ring_Main_Distribution_System.png" alt="Ring Main Distribution System" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>This type of distribution system eliminates the disadvantages of the radial system.</li>
                <li>The feeder covers the whole area of supply in the ring passion and finally terminates at the substation from where it is started. The feeder is in closed loop form and looks like a ring hence it is called as ring main system.</li>
                <li>The feeder in the ring is divided into no. of sections as AB, BC, CD, DE and EA. The various distributors are connected at point A, B, C, D and E.</li>
                <li>Each distributor is supplied by the two feeders. If there is any fault on any part of the feeder still the consumers will keep on getting the continuous supply from another feeder. Then the faulted feeder can be isolated and repaired.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Advantages of Ring Main Distribution System:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Less fluctuation at consumer side.</li>
                <li>Compare to radial system the voltage drop is less.</li>
                <li>Efficiency of the system is high.</li>
                <li>Increases the reliability of the supply as feeder is fed from two sides.</li>
                <li>Peak load can be shared.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Disadvantages of Ring Main Distribution System:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Initial cost is higher.</li>
                <li>Design is complicated.</li>
                <li>Higher maintenance coast.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Inter Connected System:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/tdu/Inter_Connected_System.png" alt="Inter Connected System" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;">
            </div>
            <p>The inter connection of different generating stations in parallel so to transfer power from one part to other during normal and emergency conditions is called interconnected system. This is also called as national grid.</p>
            <p>In such interconnected system the feeder is energized by two or more stations. This ensures reliability and security of an electric supply.</p>
            <p>The figure shows an interconnected distribution system. The feeder ring ABC is supply from two substations S1 and S2 at the point B and C. the distributors are connected to the point P, Q and R.</p>
            <p>If there is any problem to one substation, supply can be maintained from other substation.</p>
            <h4>Advantages of Inter Connected System:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Increases reliability of the supply.</li>
                <li>Peak load can be adjusted.</li>
                <li>Increases the efficiency of the system,</li>
                <li>Reduces the cost of reserve capacity.</li>
                <li>Stations are operated economically.</li>
                <li>Low capital cost.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Disadvantages of Inter Connected System</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The overall system becomes complicated.</li>
                <li>Stability problems due to inter connection.</li>
                <li>Problem in maintaining system frequency.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>AC Distribution:</h3>
            <p>The AC distribution is classified into two types.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Primary Distribution</li>
                <li>Secondary Distribution</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Primary Distribution:</h3>
            <p>At the substation the voltage level is reduced to 6.6 KV, 3.3 KV or 11 KV with the help of step down transformers. It uses three phase three wire underground system and the power is further transmitted to the local distribution centers. This primary distribution is also called as high voltage distribution. For the large consumers like factories and industries the power is directly transmitted to such loads from a substation. Such big loads have their own substations.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/tdu/Primary_Distribution.png" alt="Primary Distribution" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;">
            </div>
            <h3>Secondary Distribution:</h3>
            <p>Secondary distribution is the part of AC power system network. Secondary distributors are those lines which distributes electrical energy in locations where direct consumers can use this energy. The secondary distribution is carried out by three phase four wire system. The secondary distribution lines are pulled from distribution substations of 11 KV to 230 V or 440 V and are run along the side of each and every road of the locality.</p>
            <p>The voltage rating of secondary distribution system is 440 V between lines and 230 V between line and neutral.</p>
            <p>The three phase loads are connected across the three phases either in star or delta.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/tdu/Secondary_Distribution.png" alt="Secondary Distribution" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;">
            </div>
            <h3>DC Distribution System:</h3>
            <p>Dc distribution system is classified into two types.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Two wire DC distribution system</li>
                <li>Three wire DC distribution system</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Two wire DC distribution system:</h4>
            <p>This distribution system consists of two wires which are supplied by DC source. The outgoing wire is a positive wire and the return wire is a negative wire. The loads like lamps, motors etc. are connected in parallel between positive and negative wires. It is generally used for one standard value of low voltage.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/tdu/2_Wire_DC_Distribution.png" alt="Two wire DC distribution system" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            </div>
            <h4>Three wire DC distribution system:</h4>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/tdu/3_Wire_DC_Distribution.png" alt="Three wire DC distribution system" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
            </div>
            <p>This system consists of three wires, in which two wires are outers and one is neutral. The neutral wire is earthed at a substation. These three wires are supplied from DC source and two voltages can be obtained by this method.</p>
            <p>The voltage 1 V is available between any one outer wire and a neutral then voltage available between two outer will be 2 V that us double of the voltage between outer and neutral. The low voltage loads like lamps, domestic appliances are connected between outer and a neutral. And high voltage loads like motors etc. are connected between two outers.</p>
            <h3>DC distribution calculation:</h3>
            <p>While designing distribution line the main factor considered is a voltage drop. The voltage drop depends upon a nature of the current loading on the distributor and the way of feeding.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>According to the loading the distributor are classified as,
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>Concentrated loading</li>
                        <li>Uniformly distributed loading</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>According to the feeding the distributors are classified as,
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>Fed at one end only</li>
                        <li>Fed at both the ends
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li>At equal voltage</li>
                                <li>At unequal voltage</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Voltage drop calculation:</h3>
            <h4>a) Two wire DC distributor fed at one end with concentrated load:</h4>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/tdu/Voltage_Drop_Calculation.png" alt="Voltage drop calculation" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;">
            </div>
            <p>The above figure shows a single line diagram of a two wire DC distributor fed at one end F.</p>
            <p>Let the concentrated loads I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>, I<sub>3</sub> and I<sub>4</sub> at point A, B, C and D.</p>
            <p>Therefore,</p>
            <p>Current in CD, I<sub>CD</sub>=I<sub>4</sub><br>Current in BC, I<sub>BC</sub>=I<sub>3</sub>+ I<sub>4</sub><br>Current in AB, I<sub>AB</sub>= I<sub>2</sub>+ I<sub>3</sub>+ I<sub>4</sub><br>Current in FA, I<sub>FA</sub>=I<sub>1</sub>+ I<sub>2</sub>+ I<sub>3</sub>+ I<sub>4</sub></p>
            <p>Let R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub> and R<sub>4</sub> be the resistance of two wires that is outgoing and return for a section FA, AB, BC and CD of the distributor.</p>
            <p>Therefore, voltage drop in section FA,</p>
            <div style="overflow-x: auto">
                \[{V_{FA}} = {I_{FA}} \times {R_{FA}}\]
            </div>
            <div style="overflow-x: auto">
                \[{V_{FA}} = \left( {{I_1} + {I_2} + {I_3} + {I_4}} \right) \times {R_1}\]
            </div>
            <p>Similarly in section AB,</p>
            <div style="overflow-x: auto">
                \[{V_{AB}} = \left( {{I_2} + {I_3} + {I_4}} \right) \times {R_2}\]
            </div>
            <div style="overflow-x: auto">
                \[{V_{BC}} = \left( {{I_3} + {I_4}} \right) \times {R_3}\]
            </div>
            <div style="overflow-x: auto">
                \[{V_{CD}} = \left( {{I_4}} \right) \times {R_4}\]
            </div>
            <p>Therefore voltage drop in complete distributor FD is,</p>
            <div style="overflow-x: auto">
                \[{V_{FD}} = \left( {{I_1} + {I_2} + {I_3} + {I_4}} \right) \times {R_1}) + \left( {\left( {{I_2} + {I_3} + {I_4}} \right) \times {R_2}} \right) + \left( {\left( {{I_3} + {I_4}} \right) \times {R_3}} \right) + \left( {\left( {{I_4}} \right) \times {R_4}} \right)\]
            </div>
