            <h3 id="intro">Introduction on Industrial Safety:</h3>
            <p>Industrial safety is becoming a very important aspect of heavy losses to both in employees and employers due to accidents. Lacks of workers loss their life every year in the world due to industrial accidents. The industrial safety announcement was started in 1912 to the govt. of India to provide a safety to the industry and also the industrial workers.</p>
            <h3>Need for Industrial Safety Measure:</h3>
            <p>The industrial safety is very important because every year more number of industrial accidents are occur result in temporary or permanent disable or death of employees. It also involves heavy losses from waste in man hours, machine hours, compensation amount, training for new employees etc.</p>
            <p>Safety measures result in improving the conditions under which workers are employed it improves not only their physical efficiency but also provide protection to their life and parts of there is no safety measures in factories. It may lead to increase in the number of accidents, human failure due to carelessness, ignorance, inadequate skill and improper super vision as also contributed to accidents.</p>
            <P>Other factors increase need for safety measures are.</P>
            <ul>

            </ul>
            <h3 id="ozone">Ozone Layer and its Depletion:</h3>
            <p>A layer of ozone about 20 to 25 km is present in the atmosphere in very small quantities. It filters the harmful ultraviolet radiations and prevents them from reaching the surface of the earth. Thus this ozone layer as a shield protecting the life on earth from the harmful effects of UV radiations found sun radiations.</p>
            <p>The stratosphere contains a layer of ozone that protects surface from UV radiations coming from the sun. However some pollution enters the stratosphere there by depleting it. The ozone reacts with florin, water vapors and nitrogen oxide released by high air craft, chloro fluro carbon (CFC) which are widely used in refrigerators and fire extinguishers, huge gases, smoke and chemicals emitted by industrial plants and automobiles.</p>
            <p>Volcanic eruption is also depleting ozone because they emit sulphur in the atmosphere.</p>
            <p>The rate of production of CFC continues at the same rate then the rate of ozone decomposition would increase by accumulation of chlorine in the stratosphere which further depletes the ozone layer.</p>
            <h3>Process of Ozone Layer Depletion:</h3>
            <p>The chloro fluro carbon (CFC) used in refrigerators and air conditioners slowly rise in atmosphere. It contains chlorine, fluorine and carbon. When they reach in to the stratosphere they broke down by reaction with UV rays from the sun. This causes them to release chlorine. The chlorine reacts with ozone and destroys ozone molecules hence depletion of ozone layer occurs.</p>
            <h3>Effects of Ozone Depletion:</h3>
            <p>Human health is adversely affected and it also affects the agricultural process. Following are some of the effects of ozone depletion.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Earth excuse exposure to UV radiations leads to several health problems in humans such as eye problems, skin cancer.</li>
                <li>It damages the immune system (reduced resistance to decrease).</li>
                <li>Shorter life of plastic and paint.</li>
                <li>Restricted growth and crop damage.</li>
                <li>Destruction of water life.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="global-warm">Global Warming:</h3>
            <p>The increase of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere leads to greenhouse effect which further causes gradual heating of earth called global warming.</p>
            <p>The primary source of carbon dioxide is the consumption of fossil fuels. The cement manufacturing will also contribute to increase CO2 in the atmosphere.</p>
            <p>The major absorption of CO2 are plants and oceans, but production of CO2 is faster than its absorption. Therefore the level of CO2 is increasing in the atmosphere. This increase of CO2 in atmosphere which influences the climate is called the greenhouse effect. The layer of CO2 acts like a glass in a greenhouse it allows the sun rays to pass through it and heat up the earth but it does not allow the heat radiations re-emit by earth. The net result of all these is increase in heating of earth which is called global warming.</p>
            <h3>Effects of Global Warming:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It increases the earth temperature by 4<sup>0</sup> to 6<sup>0</sup>.</li>
                <li>If earth continuous to warm then all the glaciers (ice caps in Antarctic) and the arctic will begin to melt. So that the sea level increases and most of the cities on the sea shore will be sub merged.</li>
                <li>The global warming reduces the natural phenomenon of the nature.</li>
                <li>The global warming disturbs the normal life of the earth.</li>
                <li>It affects the climatic changes.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Remedies against Global Warming:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduction of deforestation and increase in forest.</li>
                <li>The restriction on automobiles and industries.</li>
                <li>Development of community base factories.</li>
                <li>Strict low against the usage of fuel.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="eia">Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA):</h3>
            <p>It is a process of evaluating the environmental impact of a project taking into account which relate social economic, cultural and human health impact, both beneficial and adverse effect.</p>
            <p>It can be also defined as a tool use to identify environmental, social and economic impacts of a project to take decisions.</p>
            <h3>Aim of EIA:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Modify and improve design.</li>
                <li>Protect human health and safety.</li>
                <li>Avoid serious and inversible damage to the environment.</li>

                <li>Efficient resources use to reduce social and economic aspects.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Need of EIA:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It reduces environmental impact and other adverse effect of a project.</li>
                <li>Waste minimizing, reuse, recycling, disposal and tracking.</li>

            <h3>Methodology of EIA:</h3>
            <P><b>1. Project Screening:</b> In this application the EIA screening is done about project operating in a country. It may have significant environmental impacts.</P>
            <P><b>2. Scoping:</b> It identifies environmental issues to the early stage.</P>
            <P><b>3. Consideration of Alternatives:</b> It includes alternative approaches which includes project location, layout processes, process and other operating conditions.</P>
            <P><b>4. Description of the Project:</b> In this step it understands various characteristics stages of development locations and processes.</P>
            <P><b>5. Description of environmental Line:</b> It includes the establishment of both present and feature state of environment, in the absence of project. It also considered the changes resulting from natural events and from human activities.</P>
