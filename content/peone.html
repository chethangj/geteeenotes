            <p>Power diodes are required in most of the power converters. Power diode is a unidirectional device.</p>
            <p>When anode A is positive with respect to cathode (k) diode starts conducting, current flows from anode to cathode and diode set to be forward bias.</p>
            <p>When cathode voltage is greater than anode voltage than the diode do not conduct and is set to be reverse bias which is shown in above figure a.</p>
            <h4>Structure of Power Diode:</h4>
            <p>Figure b shows the structure of power diode.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The n+ subtract forms the cathode of the diode.</li>
                <li>The pn junction is formed by diffusing a heavily doped p+ region. This p+ region forms anode of the diode.</li>
                <li>The thickness of n- drift region depends upon the breakdown voltage of the diode.</li>
                <li>For higher breakdown voltage drift region is wide and almost absent for low power signal diode.</li>
                <li>This power diode conducts only in forward bias condition that is from anode to cathode.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>VI Characteristics of Power Diode:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/pe/Diode_VI_Char.png" alt="VI Char of Diode" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;">
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>When the positive of the supply is given to anode and negative of the supply is given to cathode then the diode is set to be forward bias. In forward bias condition anode current increases linearly with voltage.</li>
                <li>The negative of the supply is connected to the anode and positive of the supply is connected to the cathode then the supply is connected to the cathode then the diode is set to reverse biased. When diode is reverse biased very small anode current flows called as leakage current.</li>
                <li>When the voltage exceeds VRBD, anode current rises rapidly hence large power dissipation takes place in the diode which may damage the device. This can be avoided by operating the diode bellow the breakdown voltage. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Applications of Power Diode:</h3>
            <p>They are used in rectifiers, voltage amplifiers, battery chargers, chopper, inverters, and converters.</p>
            <h3>Thyristor:</h3>
            <p>Thyristors are the oldest semiconductor devices which are used in power controlled applications. There are 2 types of Thyristors.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Unidirectional Thyristor</li>
                <li>Bidirectional Thyristor</li>

            <p>SCR is a four layer; three terminal semiconductor device which is shown is above figure.</p>
            <h4>Structure:</h4>
            <p>It consists of three pn junction namely J1, J2 and J3. Anode (A) is taken out from the P1 layer and cathode (K) is taken out from the N2 layer and gate (G) is taken out from the P2 layer. The gate terminal is used to turn ON the device which is shown in the above figure.</p>
            <p>SCR is having three basic modes of operation.</p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>Forward blocking mode (FBM)</li>
                <li>Forward conduction mode (FCM)</li>
                <li>Reverse blocking mode (RBM)</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Working of SCR:</h4>
            <h4>(i)  Forward Biased:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>When anode is positive with respect to cathode SCR is set to be forward bias which is shown in fig (a).</li>
                <li>During forward blocking mode, I<sub>g</sub>=0 that is gate is kept open, under this condition junction J1 and J3 is forward bias J2 is reverse bias. Therefore SCR will not conduct when a small voltage is applied.</li>
                <li>But if applied voltage (V<sub>AK</sub>) is increased to a certain value called forward break over voltage (V<sub>BO</sub>) then the junction J2 is breakdown. This causes SCR to conduct hence called as forward conduction mode even when gate is kept open.</li>
                <li>In ON state the current through the SCR is large and it can be controlled by the applied voltage and external resistance.</li>
            </ul>

            </div>
            <h4>(ii) Reverse Bias:</h4>
            <p>When anode is made negative with respect to cathode SCR is set to be reverse bias. In this mode junction J1 and J3 is reverse bias and J2 is forward bias. There is no current in the gate terminal expect reverse leakage current flow to the SCR. Hence SCR will be in the OFF state. This mode is called as reverse blocking mode shown in fig (b).</p>
            <p>If reverse voltage V<sub>AK</sub> is increases to a certain value called reverse break over voltage (V<sub>RO</sub>) then a large current will start to flow in SCR which may damage SCR.</p>

            <h3>VI Characteristics of SCR:</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/pe/SCR_VI_Char.png" alt="VI Characteristics of SCR" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;">
            </div>
            <h4>Forward bias:</h4>
            <p>The above graph shows the VI or static characteristics of SCR.</p>
            <p>From point O to A current is very small (minority charge carriers) SCR is in OFF state. This mode is called forward blocking mode whenever the forward voltage (V<sub>AK</sub>) reaches forward break over voltage (V<sub>BO</sub>) the thyristor (SCR) turns ON, junction J2 breakdown and anode current increases rapidly (I<sub>A</sub>) shown in the figure from B to C. now the device is set to be in forward conduction mode.</p>
            <h4>Latching Current (I<sub>L</sub>):</h4>
            <p>It is the minimum anode current required maintaining the SCR in ON state immediately after a thyristor has been turned ON, gate signal has been removed.</p>
            <p>“The ability of SCR to remain conducting even when gate signal is removed is known as latching current.” The region C is in forward conduction mode.</p>
            <h4>Holding Current (I<sub>H</sub>):</h4>
            <p>It is the minimum anode current to maintain the SCR in ON state but the holding current is less than the latching current i.e., I<sub>H</sub> less than I<sub>L</sub>, when anode current reduces bellow the holding current SCR turns OFF.</p>
            <h4>Reverse Biased Characteristics:</h4>
            <p>A very small current flows to the SCR due to minority charge carriers. When the reverse voltage reaches reverse break over voltage SCR conducts called reverse blocking mode but the device gate is damaged.</p>

            <p><cite>Fig (b): Basic Structure</cite></p>
            </div>
            <p><b>Construction:</b></p>
            <p>A thyristor can be considered as two complementary transistors one is pnp (Q1) and another is npn (Q2). The base of the transistor Q1 is connected to the collector of Q2. Similarly base of the transistor Q2 is connected to the collector of Q1. In this circuit we have an action of positive feedback or regeneration. It means that if there is any change in current at any point in the loop formed by transistor Q1 and Q2 it is amplified and return to the starting point with the same phase.</p>
            <p><b>Working:</b></p>
            <p>Fig a and b shows the equivalent circuit and basic structure of two transistor model of SCR. If the base current of transistor Q2 increases the collector current of transistor Q2 is also increased. It causes more base current through the transistor Q1 due to which collector current of Q1 also increases. This action will continue till both the transistors are driven into the saturation. In this circuit SCR act as ON switch and it will pass current from anode to cathode.</p>

            </div>
            <p><b>Construction:</b></p>
            <p>TRIAC is a bidirectional switching device. It conducts both the direction that is forward and reverse bias. Therefore it acts as an AC switch which can control AC whereas SCR conducts only in one direction.</p>
            <p>TRIAC has three terminals that is main terminal 1 (MT1), main terminal (MT2) and gate (G) which is shown in the above fig a and b. it consists of TRIAC equivalent circuit in which two SCR’s are connected antiparallel with common gate terminal fig © the shows sectional view or construction of TRIAC.</p>
            <p>It consist of two type (n type and p type) 4 layers with a common gate terminal (N3). Therefore P1N1P2N2 forms SCR2 and P2N1P1N4 forms SCR1.</p>
            <h3>Gate triggering modes of TRIAC:</h3>
            <p>table</p>
            <p>There are four operating modes in a TRIAC operation depending upon the polarity of voltage across its main terminal and gate terminal.</p>
            <h4>Mode 1:</h4>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/pe/TRIAC_Mode1.png" alt="TRIAC Mode1" style="width: 100%; max-width: 200px;">

            </div>
            <p>MT2 is made positive and gate is positive. It operates in 1st quadrant the operation is just like SCR. The current flows from MT2 to MT1 through the switch P1N1P2N2. It requires less gate current to turn ON TRIAC which is shown in above fig.</p>
            <h4>Mode 2:</h4>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/pe/TRIAC_Mode2.png" alt="TRIAC Mode2" style="width: 100%; max-width: 200px;">

            </div>
            <p>MT2 is made positive and gate is negative, it operates in 1st quadrant that is forward biased and current flows from MT2 to MT1 through the switch P1N1P2N2. It requires high gate current shown in figure.</p>
            <h4>Mode 3:</h4>
            <div style="text-align: center">

            </div>
            <p>MT2 is negative and gate is positive it operates in 3rd quadrant which is reverse biased and current flows from MT1 to MT2. Higher gate current is required to turn ON TRIAC. The current flows through the switch P2N1P1N4 shown in figure.</p>
            <h4>Mode 4:</h4>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/pe/TRIAC_Mode4.png" alt="TRIAC Mode4" style="width: 100%; max-width: 200px;">

            <p>MT2 is negative and gate is negative it operates in 3rd quadrant which is reverse biased. The current flows from Mt1 to MT2 through the switch P2N1P1N4. It requires less gate current to turn ON the TRIAC shown in figure.</p>
            <p>Normally mode 1 and mode 4 are the preferred modes of operation of TRIAC.</p>

            <p>When forward biased that is MT2 is positive with respect to MT1 then current flows from MT2 to MZT1 through the switch P1N1P2N2 which operates in 1st quadrant.</p>
            <p>When MT2 is negative with respect to MT1 then it is set to be reversed biased. The current flows from MT1 to MT3 through the switch P2N1P1N4 which operates in 3rd quadrant.</p>
            <p>When gate drive is applied to the TRIAC it is turned ON at lower voltage. The characteristic of TRIAC is similar in both forward and reverse direction (biased).</p>

            <p>A DIAC is a two terminal bidirectional triggering device which can be switched from OFF state to the ON state during both the cycle (forward and reverse bias (or) positive and negative cycle) of AC input signal. This device consists of 2 PNPN section switches connected in antiparallel which is shown in fig (b) but it has no gate terminal. DIAC is similar to 2 SCR’s connected in antiparallel without a gate terminal. It is also called as trigger diode. The symbol is shown in fig (a).</p>
            <h4>Operation of DIAC:</h4>
            <p>The section P1N1P2N2 has junctions J2, J3, J4 similarly the section P2N1P1N3 as junction J1, J2, J3.</p>
            <p>When MT1 is positive and MT2 is negative and the voltage is increases and the DIAC turns ON which offers negative resistance and current flows from MT1 to MT2.</p>
            <p>Similarly MT2 is made positive and MT1 is made negative when voltage is increases the DIAC turns ON which offers negative resistance and current flows from MT2 to MT1.</p>
            <p>When the applied voltage is less than V<sub>BO</sub> or V<sub>BR</sub> the DIAC blocks the flow of current and ac as open switch that is device is in OFF state.</p>
            <p>When the applied voltage exceeds V<sub>BO</sub> or V<sub>BR</sub> the DIAC conducts and the current start flowing from MT1 to MT2 or MT2 to MT1 at the device set to be ON state.</p>
            <h3>Applications of DIAC:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>They are widely used in AC control circuit such as lamp dimmers, heat control, motor speed control etc.</li>
                <li>Trigger devices for SCR control applications.</li>

            <p>The light activated SCR can be triggered using a beam of light. Its gate region is photo sensitive. Figure (a) shows the symbol and figure (b) shows the VI characteristics of LASCR.</p>
            <p>It has four layer 3 junctions just like an SCR. There is no gate terminal. Figure (b) shows the structure of LASCR. The layer P1 is exposed to sun light triggers the LASCR.</p>
            <p>When light is incident in P1 region, electron hole pairs diffuse towards P1N1 that is junction J3. Now junctions J1 J3 is forward biased and J2 is reverse biased hence more light is required to break down the junction J2. If the junction J2 is broken then the current across J2 increases which drops voltage across anode and cathode this makes LASCR to turn ON.</p>
            <p>LASCR turns ON even at low anode to cathode voltage if incident light intensity is higher.</p>
            <h3>Advantages of LASCR:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It can be turned ON by a beam of light.</li>
                <li>Low power losses in ON state.</li>
                <li>Turn ON time is short.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Applications:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It is used in high power applications like HVDC transmission.</li>
                <li>Used in noise environments for better triggering control.</li>

            <p>In NPN BJT when the base emitter junction is forward bias the transistor turns ON and current flows from collector to emitter. The BJT turns OFF as soon as base emitter drive is removed.</p>
            <p>In PNP BJT the base emitter junction is forward bias the transistor turns ON and current flows from emitter to collector. The BJT turns OFF as soon as base emitter drive is removed.</p>
            <p>Power transistor or BJT is a bipolar device. There are two types NPN and PNP.</p>

            <p>Figure shows the VI characteristics of BJT. These characteristics are also called output characteristics. The collector current IC is plotted with respect to collector emitter voltage for different values of base current. There are four region namely cutoff region, active region, quasi saturation and hard saturation.</p>
            <h3>BJT as a switch:</h3>
            <p>In On state BJT operates in quasi or hard saturation region. In OFF state BJT operates in cutoff region.</p>
            <p><b>Cutoff region:</b> The cutoff region is the area where base current is almost 0. Hence no current flows and transistor is OFF.</p>
            <p><b>Quasi and Hard Saturation:</b> In quasi and hard saturation when base drive is applied and transistor is set to be turn ON. Hence the collector current flows depending upon the load and also flows from collector to emitter.</p>
            <p><b>Active Region:</b> BJT is never operated in active region. In this region BJT acts as an amplifier.</p>
            <p><b>Note:</b> Transistor is current control device. The base current decides it is in ON state or OFF state. In transistor base is a control terminal.</p>

                <li>When transistor is made to operate in active region then it acts as an amplifier.</li>
                <li>When it is made to operate in cutoff region and saturation region it acts as a switch. For power electronic applications transistor is mainly used as a switch.

                <li>In figure (b) shows that when base drive is applied collector current does not start flowing because collector base junction capacitance (C<sub>BE</sub>) state charging after the base drive is applied.</li>

                <li>The gate metal is connected to the P type region in between an insulating gate oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) layer exists.</li>
                <li>Figure (c) shows the four layer structure of N-Channel enhancement MOSFET. This is n+ p n- n+ structure. A drift region (n-) is lightly doped is shown in structure.</li>
                <li>In this structure gate overlaps the P type and n+ region. Source also overlaps the P type and n+ region.</li>
                <li>When gate to source (V<sub>GS</sub>) voltage is applied, accumulation layer of electrons is generated in the body region (P type) near oxide layer called induced channel of electrons.</li>
                <li>Therefore the drain to source current (I<sub>DS</sub>) flows through this induced channel. When VGS is equal to zero, induced channel absent. Therefore no I<sub>DS</sub> current flows. This is called N-channel enhancement MOSFET.</li>
                <li>Current I<sub>DS</sub> starts flowing from drain to source because of drift region ON state voltage drop of MOSFET increases thickness of drift region determines the breakdown voltage of MOSFET.</li>
                <li>Here parasitic BJT is former base is in P type, emitter is in n+ and collector is in n- drift region. Emitter and base of the parasitic BJT are shorted to source, BJT does not conduct.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>IGBT is a voltage controlled switch. It is obtained by combining the property of MOSFET and BJT. The gate circuit of MOSFET and collector emitter circuit of BJT is combining together to form a new device called IGBT. Hence IGBT have advantages of both BJT and MOSFET.</li>
                <li>BJT have low ON state losses for high value of current but MOSFET can turned ON and OFF faster hence MOSFET have high ON state losses.</li>
                <li>The drive circuit of BJT is complex but drive circuit of MOSFET is simple hence IGBT is formed.</li>
                <li>IGBT has three terminals gate, collector and emitter. Therefore current flows from collector to emitter.</li>
                <li>When gate to emitter voltage is applied IGBT is turned ON. When gate to emitter voltage is removed IGBT turned OFF. Thus gate has fully controlled over the conduction of IGBT.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>UJT is three terminal single junction two layer device and it is similar to a thyristor compare to a transistor. It has high impedance in OFF state and low impedance in ON state.</li>
                <li>PN junction has P region and N region the emitter is of p type. The silicon bar has two ohmic contacts which have base 1 and base 2.</li>
                <li>The resistance between B1 and B2 when the emitter is open circuit is called inter base resistance.</li>
                <li>The emitter junction is usually situated closer to base 2 than base 1.</li>
                <li>The symbol of UJT is shown. When device is forward biased it is active or is in the conduction state.</li>

            </ul>
            <p><b>Operation:</b></p>
            <p>(i)	UJT turned ON:</p>
            <p>When emitter supply voltage V<sub>E</sub> is applied voltage increases slowly and emitter current I<sub>E</sub> flows through the diode V<sub>D</sub>. V<sub>E</sub> or V<sub>X</sub> increases above the n.V<sub>BB</sub> UJT is turned ON.</p>
            \[{V_E} = {V_X} = \eta .{V_{BB}}\]
            <p>Where,<br>h= 0.63 for silicon diode.<br>V<sub>X</sub>= potential difference at point X.</p>
            <p>(ii)	UJTT is turned OFF:</p>
            <p>When the emitter current I<sub>E</sub> is less than the valley current I<sub>V</sub> UJT is turned OFF.<br>i.e., I<sub>E</sub> less than I<sub>V</sub></p>
            <p>This valley current acts like holding current for the UJT.</p>

                <li>In this figure shows that before point A UJT operated in cutoff region and it is turned OFF. That is I<sub>E</sub> less than I<sub>V</sub></li>
                <li>After point B UJT is operated in saturation region hence UJT is turned ON. Here equation.</li>
                <li>When V<sub>X</sub> is equal to n.V<sub>BB</sub> holes from heavily doped emitter of P region are injected to the N region bar. Because of this large numbers of holes resistance RB1 reduces. This causes the voltage VX dropped.</li>
                <li>At the same time emitter current IE increases further this forms a negative resistance region as shown in figure from point A to B of the characteristics.</li>

                <li>GTO is called as gate turn OFF thyristor. It is similar to the SCR but it can be turned OFF by gate terminal/ figure shows the bidirectional current flows through the gate.</li>
                <li>A small positive voltage is applied to gate to cathode of GTO a positive current flow through the gate of GTO then GTO is turned ON. Similarly GTO can be turned OFF by negative current flows through the gate. Hence gate has fully controlled over the conduction of GTO.</li>
                <li>GTO do not requires any commutation circuit for turn OFF because it is turn OFF by applying negative gate current.</li>
                <li>The operation of GTO can be explained with the help of two transistor analogy. The gain of the transistor is reduced. This reduces the regenerative action.</li>
