            <h3 id="pf-impedance">Power Factor Impedance:</h3>
            <p><b>Introduction:</b> PF is measurement of how efficiently a facility uses electrical energy. A hoig PF means electrical capacity is utilized effectively, where low PF indicates poor utilization of electrical power. PF involves the relationship between these 2 types of power. Active power measured in kilo watts (kW) and reactive power measured in kilo volt ampere (KVAR). Active and reactive power makes apparent power which is measured in KVA.</p>
            <p><b>Definition:</b> PF is a ratio between active power and apparent power. Active power does work and reactive power produces an electromagnetic field for inductive loads.</p>
            <h3>Correcting Poor Power Factor:</h3>
            <p>Adding capacitance can correct poor PF. PF correction capacitors supplies the necessary reactive portion of power for inductive devices. So this generally results in a reduction in total consumer demand and energy charges. A PF correction requirement determines the total amount of capacitors required at the low voltage levels. PF improvement devices such as capacitors should be installed near the load for improvement.</p>
            <h3>Power Factor Improvements Methods:</h3>
            <p>The following equipment’s are methods are used for PF improvements.</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Static Capacitor</li>
                <li>Synchronous condenser</li>
                <li>Phase advancer</li>
            </ol>
            <ol type="1">
                <li><b>Static Capacitor:</b></li>
                <p>These are connected in parallel with the industrial load which works on low PF. Capacitor provides leading current which neutralize lagging inductive components and thus PF is improved which results in energy conservation and improve efficiency of the system. A low PF is expensive and inefficient and sometimes companies may charge additional electricity fees when the PF is less than 0.9.</p>
                <li><b>Synchronous Condenser:</b></li>
                <p>Over excited synchronous motor is called as synchronous condenser, when it is connected across the supply voltage then it draws leading current and partially eliminates the reactive components and hence PF is improved and results in energy conservation.</p>
                <li><b>Phase Advancers:</b></li>
                <p>There are simply AC exciter which is connected on the main shaft of the motor and operates with the motor rotor circuits for PF improvement. In industry for induction motor these are used. Whenever PF of motor is improved it leads to energy conservation.</p>
            </ol>
            <h3 id="pri-elc">Pricing of Electricity:</h3>
            <p>It is referred to as electricity tariff or the price of electricity. It varies widely from county to country and varied from locality to locality with particular country. There are many reasons for these differences in price. The price of power generation depends largely on the type and market price of fuel used, government subsidies, industrial regulations and local weather condition.</p>
            <h3>Factors Influencing the Electricity Prices:</h3>
            <p>There are several factors that influence the price of electricity.</p>
            <ul>

                <li>Power plants.</li>
                <li>Transmission and distribution system.</li>
                <li>Weather conditions.</li>
                <li>Government and industrial regulations.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Variation of Electricity Pricing:</h3>
            <p>The following points tell about the variation of electricity pricing.</p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li><b>Electricity Prices is highest in summer:</b></li>
                <p>Basically a electricity pricing are fully depends upon the electricity demand by a consumer changes in prices reflect variations in electricity demand, availability of different generation sources, fuel cost and power plant availability. Prices are usually highest in summer when total demand is high and when more expansive generation is added to meet the demand.</p>
                <li><b>Electricity prices vary by the type of consumer or customer:</b></li>
                <p>Electricity prices are usually highest for residential and commercial consumer cause it cost more to distribute electricity to them. Industrial consumers use more electricity and they can receive at high voltages so it is more efficient, less expansive and price of power is closer to wholesale price of electricity.</p>
